Every team is here for a reason,\" said Rodriguez, whose goal tally across all competitions stands at 127.\n\n“We’ve got a tough side to beat in Fulham.

article will give advice to ensure you are ‘web’ ready for when Burnley Football Club can invite fans back to the stadium be that the 2020\u002F21 season or the next.\n\nWe do look forward to welcoming you back, but we must make you aware that a match day at Turf Moor will likely be a very different experience. We request you do a number of things to make sure you are ready to get back the the Turf.\n\nAs mentioned in previous communications, any return to Turf Moor may involve season ticket holders being required to enter an online ticket ballot. To do this and ensure you are ready for this process please take special notice of the steps below.\n\n**1.\tUpdate your details.** \n\nTickets for games will now be processed digitally via email. \n\nThere will be no paper tickets printed by Burnley Football Club. Supporters must ensure they have their online ticket account updated as tickets will be emailed to the lead purchaser. \n\nTo make sure your details are up to date go to the ‘Update details’ menu link at the tickets.burnleyfc.com website, or **[CLICK HERE](https:\u002F\u002Ftickets.burnleyfc.com\u002FPagesLogin\u002FProfile\u002FupdateProfile.aspx?)**. Update your details if required.\n\n**2.\tRe-link your friends and family.** \n\nThe recent upgrade to the ticket system and changes to data protection laws over the past few years has meant that the **‘Friends & Family’** accounts have been reset. \n\nSupporters now have the opportunity to link Burnley fans who live in their household. This will allow one lead purchaser to buy tickets on behalf of their friends & family and sit together on match day.\n\nPlease bear in mind, when adding ‘friends & family’ there may still be a limit to only attend with people from your own household\u002Fsocial bubble and the rule of six. Therefore, a maximum of six persons may sit together for a match at Turf Moor.\n\nTo add friends and family, simply click the ‘Friends and Family’ menu link at tickets.burnleyfc.com or **[CLICK HERE](https:\u002F\u002Ftickets.burnleyfc.com\u002FPagesLogin\u002FFriendsAndFamily\u002FFriendsAndFamily.aspx)**. From there, simply add the Clarets Number, last name, and postcode of the person you would like to add in the boxes provided. \n\nTo confirm select **‘Add to my friends and family’**. Repeat this process for up five people.\n\nOnce you have done the above, you are all good to go and Burnley Football Club will release more information regarding a return to Turf Moor in due course.",sponsor:{},isHtml:a},{id:"56c90bd3-a4c5-4af0-95e4-fe842e90e474",contentType:e,image:"https:\u002F\u002Fmedia-cdn.incrowdsports.com\u002Fd81d7cf5-ae00-4c9d-92f1-eaad17d02d30.jpg",sponsor:{}},{id:"a4f8c86d-f196-4775-bcc5-5bc5c940dfe8",contentType:d,content:"**3.\tNot sure if you have an online ticketing account or have forgotten your details?**\n\nIf you do not use the ticket website regularly, are unsure if you have an online account, or have forgotten your details, then in most cases this can be resolved via a password reset.\n\nPlease head to the Forgotten Password page, or **[CLICK HERE](https:\u002F\u002Ftickets.burnleyfc.com\u002FPagesPublic\u002FProfile\u002FForgottenPassword.aspx)**. \n\nEnter your Clarets Number (the six-digit number on your seasoncard).\n\nA password reset link will be sent to the email address we have for you on your account.

This process may take a couple of days to get through all season ticket holders. If the value of your season ticket doesn't show at first, please check again a little later.\n \n**If I request a refund, why will I not be able to enter a ballot to get a match ticket if the stadium reopens in 2020\u002F2021?**\nIf Turf Moor re-opens to supporters for the 2020\u002F21 season it will, very likely at first, be at a limited capacity. The priority at that time will be for current season ticket holders to get the opportunity to attend, until such time that the stadium opens up enough to allow for general admission sales. If we are allowed to open to a more significant numbers of fans we will, of course, try and ensure you also receive a priority before general admission sales. \n \n**If I request a refund, how long will it take?**\nIf you have an online profile with the club and choose to take the funds from your ‘OnAccount’, the funds should be with you between 3-5 working days. If you are not aware of your online profile you may need to reset your details using your Clarets Number. For assistance please email [ticketoffice@burnleyfc.com](mailto:ticketoffice@burnleyfc.com)\n \n**I currently pay for my season ticket via direct debit. If I request a refund, will the DD payment option be available for the 2021\u002F2022 season?**\nThere is a huge amount of uncertainty which affects the normal planning for tickets here at Turf Moor. While we cannot at this time 100% guarantee that a 'normal' direct debit option will be available for the 2021\u002F2022 season we will do everything we can to ensure that there is a suitable 'pay-over-time' option for supporters. We understand and want to continue to offer supporters the most convenient option for them to pay for a season ticket.\n\n**I pay for my ST via Direct Debit. I do not want a refund but would like to pause my monthly payments. Can I do this?**\nYes. However, please be aware that all payments would have to be caught up if you would like your seat automatically renewed for the 2021\u002F2022 season. There will be a form you need to fill in on the OnAccount page which allow you to request a pause of your future payments.\n \n**If I choose to keep the funds for my season ticket ‘OnAccount’ will there be anything extra to pay going in to the 2021\u002F2022 season?**\nNo, by paying for a 2020\u002F2021 season now you are effectively guaranteeing your seat for the lowest possible price for the 2021\u002F2022 season.\n\n**I would like my monies back for this season, but I have every intention of coming back to the Turf in the 2021\u002F22 season. When can I renew and secure my seat again?**\nIf you choose not to attend the 20\u002F21 season and have no monies in your account after we have refunded you, we intend to open a short renewals period pre 21\u002F22 season, which will allow previous season ticket holders to resecure their 19\u002F20 season seat. The date of this window will be determined by the Government’s decision regarding the return to the stadiums in the coming months.\n\n**I chose not to renew in the Early Bird period for 20\u002F21 due to the uncertainty surrounding the season. Can I still retain my seat for the 21\u002F22 campaign, purchase a season ticket now, and is it possible for me to be entered into a potential ticket ballot?**\nWe want to reassure you that your seat will be available to renew. We also fully appreciate that your choice not to renew may have been based upon the uncertainty of the upcoming season back in the early bird renewal window (for 20\u002F21). In such cases we would ask supporters to contact the ticket office team, preferably by email, and provide an outline of your request and we can talk you through your options on a case-by-case basis. Please contact [ticketoffice@burnleyfc.com](mailto:ticketoffice@burnleyfc.com)\n \n**I chose not to renew in the Early bird period for 20\u002F21. Will you re-sell my seat this season?**\nIf and when we are permitted to welcome supporters back to Turf Moor in the 20\u002F21 season, it's anticipated it will be in much reduced numbers and will be by strict adherence to social distancing policies. In these circumstances, no supporter will be able to retain or request their ‘usual seat’.  So it may be that your usual seat could be allocated to another supporter on a match-by-match basis in the 20\u002F21 season, This is will a temporary measure and will not affect your ability to secure your 21\u002F22 season ticket    \n\n**Will the prices for 2021\u002F2022 season tickets be frozen again?**\nWhile we are proud to have been able to keep season ticket prices frozen for the past seven seasons, in the current climate we cannot guarantee this will continue. This is reviewed on an annual basis and will be looked at again as we approach the 2021\u002F2022 season. By paying your frozen price now you are guaranteeing you will have no higher price to pay for a new season ticket for the 2021\u002F22 season.\n\n**I have paid for my own, plus my two children’s season tickets on the same card. Do I need to go into each account to request refunds?**\nAnswer updated 2nd November \nYes, you will need to go into each account in order to access the OnAccount as they are personal for each supporter. Multiple accounts can be attached to the same email address to make this process easier.\n\nHowever moving forward we would strongly advise for all supporters to have their own email address as this may be required in the future to be able to email contactless ticket access to Turf Moor. \n\n**I have a zero-value season ticket (for example a personal assistant or child's ticket). Do I need to do anything to this account?**\nNo action is needed on a zero-value season ticket. We will reserve the seat as normal. We do ask that if you intend not to renew for the 2021\u002F2022 season to please let us know so we can put this seat back on sale at the appropriate time.\n\n**I have been given a season ticket as a gift, or someone else pays for my season ticket. Can I ask for a refund to my bank account?**\nNo, refunds will be processed to the card you have as your ‘saved card’ in your online ticket profile.\n\n**How long do I have to decide whether to take a refund or not. Will you impose a deadline?**\nA deadline will need to be set to end the refund process. However, currently we have not set a fixed date.\n\n**How do I check and or update my card details on my clarets account?**\nLogin to the ticket website [**HERE**](https:\u002F\u002Ftickets.burnleyfc.com\u002FPagesPublic\u002FHome\u002FHome.aspx) and click on the ‘My Saved Cards’ option or contact the ticket office team: [ticketoffice@burnleyfc.com](mailto:ticketoffice@burnleyfc.com) \n\n**I’ve chosen to cancel my direct debit payments already so I am not currently a season ticket holder or my situation isn’t covered above. What advice can you give? Can I still get a refund of the monies I’ve paid?**\nAll supporters will be eligible to request a refund. However supporters who have broken their direct debit agreement will not be able to be handled using the automatic 'OnAccount' process explained above.\n\nIn this scenario the 'refund request' will be looked at on a case-by-case basis, after the club has dealt with the 'OnAccount' refund process.\n\nWe recognise there are a lot of different scenarios and payment methods and individual circumstances to factor in, which we acknowledge, and in such cases the ticket office team can advise and deal with any supporters queries on a case by case basis if needs be. \n\nPlease watch out for further updates and bear with us when replying as we are still working through some options and listening to supporter feedback.",sponsor:{},isHtml:a},{id:nv,contentType:e,image:nw,sponsor:{}}],language:i,version:lT,source:{sourceSystem:j,overwriteEnabled:a},articleMetadata:{},categories:[{id:u,text:z},{id:X,text:W},{id:bo,text:bj},{id:by,text:ds},{id:df,text:dg}],displayCategory:{id:bo,text:bj},slug:"season-ticket-refunds-update",clientId:f,singlePage:a,linkedIds:[{text:el,sourceSystem:c,sourceSystemId:jb},{text:dx,sourceSystem:c,sourceSystemId:ek},{text:nx,sourceSystem:c,sourceSystemId:ny},{text:nz,sourceSystem:c,sourceSystemId:nA}],heroMedia:{content:{id:nB,contentType:e,title:el,image:nC,imageThumbnail:nD,sponsor:{}},title:"2020\u002F21 Season Tickets: Your Options & Frequently Asked Questions",summary:"More detailed information on rolling your season ticket payments over to 2021\u002F2022, or obtaining a refund, from 2nd November"},readTimeMinutes:k,author:{name:b,title:b,imageUrl:b,socialHandles:[]},publishDate:"2020-10-31T12:30:00.000Z",auth:{loginRequired:a,roles:[]},pinned:a,blocked:a},{id:"1b29e041-9d2d-4665-994a-83e2a8f3d987",content:[{id:"8f2f451f-07c2-49c1-b7bd-3dbf94c787ba",contentType:d,content:"Burnley Football Club and all Premier League clubs are committed to creating the most controlled and safe environments in the country in light of the current situation regarding Covid-19.\n\nIn line with that, we are continuing to work hard with the League and all relevant authorities to bring supporters back into Turf Moor on matchdays at the earliest opportunity it is deemed safe to do so.\nInevitably, that will have to be managed on a staggered basis with reduced capacity to start with.\n\nOur original target was to have supporters admitted to our home game against Tottenham Hotspur on the weekend of the 24th-25th October.

Recognising that clubs and support structures off the pitch do not reflect the increasing gender and ethnic diversity seen on the pitch, it will increase accountability and transparency and will see The FA, key stakeholders and clubs across the men’s and women’s game commit to embedding greater diversity across senior leadership teams, team operations and coaching setups.\n\nThe Code focuses on increasing equality of opportunity with hiring targets – rather than quotas – to encourage recruitment from across society. Hiring will be based on merit, to find the best person for the job from diverse talent pipelines. The aim is to move away from recruitment practices focused on personal networks, which is a longstanding challenge across football and has limited the diversity in leadership across the game.\n\nIt is viewed as a starting point towards greater diversity and, while focusing on gender and ethnicity now in reflection of the current player base, it will expand more broadly over time.\n\nThe Premier League and multiple clubs from across the Premier League, English Football League, Barclays FA Women’s Super League and FA Women’s Championship have committed to embedding the Code within its own practices. While not mandatory, The FA is encouraging all clubs across the men’s and women’s games to sign up to the voluntary Code, with a version following the same principles and adapted for the National League System and grassroots clubs to follow in Spring 2021.\n\nClubs that will adopt the Football Leadership Diversity Code as founding signatories are:\n\n•\tArsenal\n•\tAston Villa\n•\tBlackburn Rovers\n•\tBolton Wanderers\n•\tBrighton & Hove Albion\n•\tBrentford\n•\tBurnley\n•\tBurton Albion\n•\tCambridge United\n•\tChelsea\n•\tCoventry City\n•\tCoventry United\n•\tCrystal Palace\n•\tDerby County\n•\tDurham Women\n•\tEngland\n•\tEverton\n•\tFleetwood Town\n•\tFulham\n•\tIpswich Town\n•\tLeeds United\n•\tLeicester City\n•\tLewes\n•\tLincoln City\n•\tLiverpool\n•\tManchester City\n•\tManchester United\n•\tNewcastle United\n•\tNorwich City\n•\tNottingham Forest\n•\tOxford United\n•\tPlymouth Argyle\n•\tPortsmouth\n•\tQueens Park Rangers\n•\tSheffield United\n•\tStoke City\n•\tSwansea City\n•\tTottenham Hotspur\n•\tWatford\n•\tWest Ham United\n•\tWest Bromwich Albion\n•\tWolverhampton Wanderers.\n\n \nPaul Elliott, Chair of The FA’s Inclusion Advisory Board, said: \"Many clubs are already doing good work in this area and we have been pleased to see football stand together this year to challenge the injustice we are seeing in society. However, positive and tangible action is required to drive change and take the next step. We believe the introduction of the Football Leadership Diversity Code will signal a long-term change for the English game. The number and stature of clubs that have already agreed to join us on this journey proves that together, with clear goals, transparency and a desire for action, we can shape a better future together. We hope more clubs join us as we move forward.\"\n\nBy signing up to the Football Leadership Diversity Code, clubs pledge to create an equality, diversity and inclusion plan which applies hiring targets while adopting specific recruitment principles. The targets, which will become effective immediately, include:\n\n**SENIOR LEADERSHIP AND TEAM OPERATIONS**\n•\t15% of new hires will be Black, Asian or of Mixed-Heritage [or a target set by the club based on local demographics]\n•\t30% of new hires will be female\n\n**COACHING: MEN’S PROFESSIONAL CLUBS**\n•\t25% of new hires will be Black, Asian or of Mixed-Heritage \n•\t10% of new senior coaching hires will be Black, Asian or of Mixed-Heritage\n\n**COACHING: WOMEN’S PROFESSIONAL CLUBS**\n•\t50% of new hires will be female \n•\t15% of new hires will be Black, Asian or of Mixed-Heritage\n\n**RECRUITMENT**\n•\tShortlists for interview will have at least one male and one female Black, Asian or of Mixed-Heritage candidate, if applicants meeting the job specifications apply.\n\nMark Bullingham, The FA’s Chief Executive Officer, added: \"I would like to thank the players, coaches, HR Directors, media and league and club officials from across football who have contributed to the development of the Code. Together we have created commitments that will drive real change across the game. The Code will hold clubs, leagues and our own organisation to account and ensure opportunities for everyone to work at all levels in football.  We remain deeply committed to doing everything we can to address inequality in all its forms and to deliver a game free from discrimination. Today is a really positive step forward.\"\n\nSee more information on how to [sign up to the Football Leadership Diversity Code](http:\u002F\u002Fwww.TheFA.com\u002FFLDC).\n",sponsor:{},isHtml:a}],language:i,version:w,source:{sourceSystem:j,overwriteEnabled:a},singlePage:a,linkedIds:[{text:"we are in diversity code jpg.PNG",sourceSystem:c,sourceSystemId:"a25d1e5d-cb21-4136-9222-64ea3e5d1bee"}],heroMedia:{content:{id:"4bc58f91-ed92-40f4-8ee2-cff6901f395f",contentType:e,image:"https:\u002F\u002Fmedia-cdn.incrowdsports.com\u002Fa25d1e5d-cb21-4136-9222-64ea3e5d1bee.png?crop=1161:653:nowe:7:0",imageThumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fmedia-cdn.incrowdsports.com\u002Fa25d1e5d-cb21-4136-9222-64ea3e5d1bee.png?crop=1160:653:nowe:7:0",sponsor:{}},title:"Club Commits to Football Leadership Diversity Code",summary:"40+ football clubs have committed to tackle inequality across senior leadership positions, broader team operations and coaching roles"},clientId:f,readTimeMinutes:w,author:{name:b,title:b,imageUrl:b,socialHandles:[]},publishDate:"2020-10-27T13:17:47.583Z",auth:{loginRequired:a,roles:[]},pinned:a,articleMetadata:{},categories:[{id:u,text:z},{id:cv,text:bL},{id:X,text:W}],displayCategory:{id:cv,text:bL},slug:"football-diversity-leadership-code",blocked:a},{id:"04a5877e-aaec-46ed-85a2-ab8e4135b9ba",content:[{id:"2238e11c-e33a-4bb4-9976-7aa1507968a4",contentType:d,content:"The foodbank at Burnley Community Kitchen, operated by the Clarets' official charity, Burnley FC in the Community, continues to offer support for families and individuals across Burnley facing food poverty. \n\nAssisting the most vulnerable in the town, during lockdown the Foodbank moved to delivery only and has fed over 7,400 people, of which 3,000 were children, since March. \n \nThe foodbank relies completely on donations from the public and partners, working with the hardest to reach families in the borough to ensure that no children have to go hungry. \n\nIn partnership with Warburtons, Kelloggs and Clayton Park Bakery, the foodbank’s Early Kick-off Breakfast Clubs feed 2,000 local children every week. \n\nAs half-term approaches the foodbank will continue to work with community hub BurnleyTogether and the schools involved to ensure children and their families receive food parcels over the holidays. \n\nTo make a donation to the foodbank, visit the Justgiving page at www.justgiving.com\u002Fcampaign\u002Fsupportburnleyfoodbank \n\nJust £6 will feed one person for a week and £25 will feed a family of four for a week. \n\nKeep up to date with Burnley Community Kitchen on Twitter and Facebook at @BFCitCKitchen\n\n\n",sponsor:{},isHtml:a}],language:i,version:Y,source:{sourceSystem:j,overwriteEnabled:a},singlePage:a,linkedIds:[{text:nI,sourceSystem:c,sourceSystemId:"4bdcb54e-5d88-4b8e-a694-3b00334da81e"}],heroMedia:{content:{id:"441ac78f-bcc6-40fd-a7bb-0b12897bb51e",contentType:e,title:nI,image:"https:\u002F\u002Fmedia-cdn.incrowdsports.com\u002F4bdcb54e-5d88-4b8e-a694-3b00334da81e.jpg?crop=1439:539:nowe:1:242",imageThumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fmedia-cdn.incrowdsports.com\u002F4bdcb54e-5d88-4b8e-a694-3b00334da81e.jpg",sponsor:{}},title:"Burnley Foodbank: Half Term Support"},clientId:f,readTimeMinutes:g,author:{name:b,title:b,imageUrl:b,socialHandles:[]},publishDate:"2020-10-23T13:58:24.669Z",auth:{loginRequired:a,roles:[]},pinned:a,articleMetadata:{},categories:[{id:u,text:z},{id:X,text:W},{id:cv,text:bL}],displayCategory:{id:cv,text:bL},slug:"burnley-foodbank-half-term-support",blocked:a},{id:"6e6771da-74a3-4a7f-b9fe-a725a7912f66",content:[{id:"136b655e-57c4-4e26-ac44-2941ae9ea42e",contentType:d,content:"**Clarets return to action with PL2 clash at home to Palace**",sponsor:{},isHtml:a},{id:"8e7ea6ca-54cd-480d-9bb8-45e4c572ee8f",contentType:d,content:"After more than three weeks without a match, the U23s return to action this afternoon (Monday) for the first of two games in five days when Steve Stone's side hosts Crystal Palace at Leyland.\n\nThe Clarets will be looking to bounce back with a win against Palace after suffering defeat to Newcastle United in their last outing at their Lancashire FA base.\n\nAnd young striker Max Thompson, who was on the scoresheet last time out against the Geordies, is eager to get the ball rolling again and admits the squad are 'buzzing' to get playing again with the visit of the Eagles followed by a trip to Middlesbrough on Friday afternoon.\n\nThompson, who made his first team debut in June against Manchester City, said: “I am really looking forward to getting back playing feels like forever since the Newcastle game, I think the whole squad is buzzing for the match against Palace.\n",sponsor:{},isHtml:a},{id:"51f71093-f594-4d3f-8d4b-3e7b90985f2c",contentType:e,image:"https:\u002F\u002Fmedia-cdn.incrowdsports.com\u002F08bc331e-a023-4815-8331-1a73a16f62d4.jpg",sponsor:{}},{id:"c2bb6166-e78c-48cc-a1dc-62e89272ac33",contentType:d,content:"“I've really enjoyed it so far.

the first time the Clarets had retained Premier League status and the first time they had secured back-to-back top-flight seasons since 1975.\n\nAnd he then trumped that achievement in the 2017\u002F18 campaign, steering the club to a seventh place finish - their highest league standing since 1975 - and bringing European football (via the Europa League) back to Turf Moor for the first time in 51 years.\n\nMidway through that triumphant season, Dyche and his backroom team also committed themselves to the club by signing new five-year deals.\n\nThe deal, which runs until 2022, could see Dyche become the longest serving post-war manager since Harry Potts, who last steered the team into European competition in 1966\u002F67. Dyche currently ranks fourth on the all-time list.\n\nIn March, 2009, Dyche took charge of his 300th game as Burnley manager and by the end of the season had guided the Clarets to 15th place in the table - the club's second highest Premier League finish.\n\nIn doing so, Dyche's side also became the first Burnley team to rack up four succcessive seasons of top-flight football since the 1970\u002F71 season.\n\nKettering-born Dyche had previously come through the coaching ranks at Vicarage Road after ending a 17-year playing career as a central defender.\n\nStarting with Watford’s youth team after hanging up his boots in 2007 he graduated to the position of assistant manager under Malky Mackay.\n\nAnd when Mackay left Watford to join Cardiff City, Dyche was promoted to become Hornets’ manager in June, 2011, taking charge of his first League game against Burnley at Turf Moor.\n\nDespite the departure of a number of top players and working with one of the smallest budgets in the division, he went on to lead Watford to 11th-place in the Championship in 2011\u002F12– their highest finish and highest points total since 2008 - the year their relegation from the Premier League.\n\nDespite that record, Dyche lost his job in the 2012 close-season, when Watford were taken over by new Italian owners who appointed former Italy international Gianfranco Zola as manager.\n\nDyche then spent a spell working with the England under-21 side, helping them reach the finals of the 2013 European Championships as part of the staff put together by Stuart Pearce – a former playing colleague at Nottingham Forest where he started his career.\n\nAfter leaving Forest - having not played a senior game - to join Chesterfield in 1990, Dyche went on to make 269 appearances for the Spireites, captaining the club and scoring in their FA Cup semi-final against Middlesbrough in 1997.\n\nDyche also helped the Derbyshire club to promotion in 1995 and went on to win future promotions as a player at Bristol City and Millwall – both clubs going up to the Championship – before signing for Watford in 2002.\n\nThe centre-back played 78 games for the Hornets and captained them for a season before moving to Northampton Town in 2005, where he enjoyed another promotion 12 months

arrived at Turf Moor from Charlton Athletic on the same day as former Addicks teammate Johann Berg Gudmundsson in July 2016, signing a three-year deal for an undisclosed fee.\n\nThe Soham-born goalkeeper had started his career in the Academy of local club Ipswich Town.\n\nAt the age of 16, Pope joined non-league Bury Town and gained invaluable experience as the first-team goalkeeper under the stewardship of former Colchester United midfielder Richard Wilkins.\n\nWilkins predicted a bright future for the towering keeper and in the summer of 2011 he earned a move to Charlton following a successful tria spelll.\n\nHis first loan spell away from The Valley saw him join Harrow Borough, before gaining further experience at Welling United and National League side Cambridge United.\n\nOn the final day of the 2012\u002F13 campaign, Pope made his Charlton debut when he replaced David Button in a 4-1 home victory over Bristol City, having helped the club’s U21 side win the national Professional Development League 2 title.\n\nDuring the second half of the 2013\u002F14 season he joined York City on a loan deal, where impressive performances saw him keep 16 clean sheets in 24 games as the Minstermen reached the League Two play-offs.\n\nPope conceded just once across both legs of the semi-finals but that was enough to deny York a trip to Wembley as Fleetwood Town progressed.\n\nHis final loan spell during his time at the Addicks proved another success as Bury secured his services during the 2014\u002F15 season, with Pope making 22 appearances as the Shakers were promoted form League Two in third place.\n\nA more prolonged spell in the first-team at Charlton followed during the 2015\u002F16 campaign, with Pope making 24 Championship appearances, with his final game coming against Burnley as the Clarets clinched the title with victory at The Valley.\n\nContinuing to learn his trade at Turf Moor behind Tom Heaton and Paul Robinson, Pope was used as the Clarets’ main ‘cup goalkeeper’ in 2016\u002F17, keeping clean sheets against Sunderland Bristol City in the FA Cup.\n\nAnd he was then promoted to the number-two slot in the closing weeks of the season, sitting on the bench for seven successive Premier League games.\n\nFollowing an injury to Heaton in September, 2017, he made his Premier League debut and celebrated with a clean sheet against Crystal Palace at Turf Moor.\n\nIn a remarkable breakthrough season at Turf Moor, he went on to record 12 clean sheets, won both the club's annual 'Player of the Year' and 'Players' Player of the Year' awards and earned a call-up to the England squad in March, 2018 before earning a place in the 23 picked to go to the World Cup Finals in Russia.\n\nHowever, a discloated shoulder, sustained at Aberdeen in the opening Europa League game of the 2018\u002F19 season, put his first-team career on hold.\n\nPope returned to fitness and competitive action towards the end of December, 2018 in the first of a number of appearances in the Under-23s.\n\nBut he was unable to dislodge Tom Heaton and Joe Hart from the senior set-up as he was made to wait for a Premier League return, being restrcicted to two outings in the FA Cup.\n\nHis long-term value to the club remained beyond doubt, however, and in May, 2019, Pope signed a new deal to keep him at Turf Moor until June, 2023 with the option of a further 12 months.\n\nFollowing Heaton's departure to Aston Villan, Pope then started the 2019\u002F20 Premier League season back as Burnley's first choice between the posts and he was also back in the England squad for their September internationals.\n\nHis first England start then came in a 4-0 European qualifying win in Kosovo in November, 2019 as part of a memorable season.\n\nPope was an ever-present for the Clarets and his 15 clean sheets in the Premier League was a club record which left him second only to Manchester City's Ederson in the race for the golden glove.

helping Stoke achieve three successive ninth-place finishes – a club best for the Premier League era.\n\nHe signed a new 12-month contract at the end of the 2016\u002F17 season but just a couple of months late accepted the offer of a new challenge at Turf Moor, following former team-mate Jon Walters from Stoke to become as part of Sean Dyche’s re-shaped squad.\n\nBardsley also added to the number of internationals at Turf Moor, having opted to play for Scotland – the country of his father’s birth – and winning 13 caps since making a debut in 2010.\n\nHaving had to wait for his Premier Leaguue debut for the Clarets, the experienced defender made a winning start at Bournemouth at the end of November to start an uninterrupted run of 13 games which helped Burnley finish the season in seventh place and take Bardsley back into Europe.\n\nBardsley featured in the Clarets' Europa League campaign before again having to be patient for a sustained run of Premier League appearances.\n\nBut his return to the starting line-up on a regular basis at the end of December helped spark the revival that secured the Clarets' Premier League safety.\n\nBardsley went on to start a total of 19 Premier Legaue games in 2018\u002F19 to earn a 12-month extension to his contract with the Clarets.\n\nHe more than justified that extended stay with another impressive contribution in the 2019\u002F20 season which saw him start 21 top-flight games.\n\nBardsley missed the first two games following the lockdown brought about by the Covid-19 pandemic as he approached the end of his contract.\n\nBut with a new 12-month deal signed he returne to sarting duty at the age of 35 and was then a permanent fixture at right-back during the run-in as the Clarets secured a top-10 finish to set up Bardsley for a remarkable 16th consecutive season of Premier League

neighbours Accrington Stanley on loan in 2010\u002F11 and returning to the Crown Ground for a second successful spell the following season.\n\nHe scored his first League goal at Plymouth Argyle in October 2011 and after John Coleman took over as Rochdale manager, followed the former Reds’ boss into League One with a loan move to Spotland in January 2012.\n\nAfter playing 16 times for Dale, Long was called up by the Republic of Ireland under-21s for the first time for a European Championship qualifier in June, 2012 but didn't make it past the bench.\n\nLong started the 2012\u002F13 season on loan at Portsmouth but following his return to Turf Moor became a regular member of the first-team squad and made his first-senior start for the Clarets against Watford in December, 2012.\n\nThe centre-back made seven Championship appearances as Burnley won promotion to the Premier League in 2013\u002F14 but his top-flight debut on New Year’s Day, 2015 was ruined by an anterior cruciate ligament injury after coming off the bench at Newcastle United.\n\nOn his return to fitness, Long joined League One side Barnsley on loan in November 2015, helping them towards promotion, followed by a loan move to MK Dons in March 2016.\n\nHe returned to Turf Moor for the 2016\u002F17 Premier League season – signing a new contract until June, 2018 -  and after recovering from a knee injury was finally rewarded with his first Premier League start in a 2-2 draw against West Bromwich Albion which saw the Clarets ensure their top-flight safety.\n\nLong stayed in the side for the final two games of the campaign and was then called up for the first time by the senior Republic of Ireland squad, making his debut in a friendly against Mexico in the United States at the beginning of June, 2017 and starting for the first time a few days later against Uruguay.\n\nHe then capped a remarkable few months by retaining his place and making his competitive international debut for Ireland in their World Cup qualifier against Austria.\n\nThe new three-year deal quickly followed ahead of the 2017\u002F18 season when Long enjoyed his most productive campaign yet for the Clarets, starting 16 times as Burnley finished seventh in the Premier League, and also remaining as a regular for Ireland.\n\nIn 2018\u002F19, Long was limited to just five Premier League starts as Ben Mee and James Tarkowski restored their central defensive partnership.\n\nBut Long remained an integral part of the Clarets' squad - making 13 appearances in total - and stayed part of Ireland's plans under returning boss Mick McCarthy.\n\nThe centre-back again had to be patient during the 2019\u002F20 season as Mee and Tarkowski continued their productive pairing.\n\nBut, once again, Long proved his worth when he

2016-17 season, made a total of 83 appearances for the Welshmen.\n\nBut the Carshalton-born midfielder became Sean Dyche’s third signing of the summer as he headed back to Turf Moor.\n\nRemarkably, he played every minute of every game in the Premier League in the 2017\u002F18 campaign - one of only five outfield players to achieve the feat - as the Clarets posted their highest league finish since 1974 to qualify for Europe.\n\nAnd his stunning consistency was rewarded early in the campaign when he received a debut call-up into the England squad.\n\nCork duly became the 27th Burnley player to

returning home to kick-start his senior career with Breiðablik at the age of 18.\n\nHe soon established himself in the first-team during the 2008 Icelandic Premier League season and was voted the division’s best player for his performances in the latter stages of the campaign.\n\nHis form earned him a move in 2009 to Dutch Eredivise side AZ Alkmaar where he made 145 appearances and scored 13 goals during a five-year spell.\n\nGudmundsson played a key role in Alkmaar’s 2013\u002F14 Europa League campaign, scoring three times as Alkmaar reached the quarter-finals before losing to eventual

Iceland then lost 5-2 to France in the last eight.\n\nGudmundsson’s first season at Turf Moor was interrupted by injury but his 24 appearances in the Premier League helped the Clarets secure a number

Manchester City at Turf Moor, and contributing greatly to the Clarets' attacking options.\n\nHe was rewarded with a new three-year contract which he signed before linking up with Iceland for their first appearance in a World Cup finals.\n\nGudmundsson helped Iceland draw their opening group game against former champions Argentina at the 2018 tournament in Russia.\n\nHowever, injury forced him to miss a defeat to Nigeria in the following game and his return against Croatia couldn't help Iceland get the result they neeed to avoid elimination.\n\nA couple of injury problems also disrupted his 2018\u002F19 campaign with the Clarets.\n\nBut the wingman still started half of Burnley's games and came off the bench in 10 more to help the Clarets secure their top-flight status as one of Sean

Brady became Burnley’s record buy when he made the switch to Turf Moor from Norwich City on deadline day in January 2017.\n\nThe Dublin-born youngster signed a three-and-a-half-year deal, with a further year’s option.\n\nBrady was spotted playing youth football in Ireland – where he was a friend and team mate of Clarets’ midfielder Jeff Hendrick with the St Kevin’s Boys club – and signed by Manchester United as a 16-year-old.\n\nHe started life at Old Trafford in the club’s Academy set-up before graduating to the professional ranks.\n\nThe winger sought first-team football, so signed for Hull City on loan in 2011.\n\nHe made 39 Championship appearances for the Tigers in the 2011\u002F12 season as Hull finished just outside the play-off places.\n\nBrady returned to the KC Stadium in November 2012 with a second loan spell, which was made permanent in January 2013 when he joined Steve Bruce’s side for an undisclosed fee.\n\nFour goals in 32 appearances helped Hull secure automatic promotion to the Premier League, as they finished second behind Championship winners Cardiff City.\n\nBrady then scored four goals in six games at the start of the 2013\u002F14 season before injury kept him out of the closing months of the campaign, including Hull’s FA Cup final defeat to Arsenal.\n\nHull’s run to the final gave him a taste of Europe the following season, with Brady scoring twice in a Europa League qualifying-round over Belgian side Lokeren, whose away goal in the second leg was enough to knock the Tigers out.\n\nThe Republic of Ireland international went on to make 27 top-flight appearances that season but couldn’t prevent Hull’s return to the Championship, along with Burnley, in the summer of 2015.\n\nHull’s relegation prompted newly promoted Norwich City to pay a reported £7m for the winger, who missed just two games in a season long stay in the top-flight for the Canaries.\n\nThe first half of the 2016\u002F17 season saw Brady feature regularly once again, but the chance of a third crack at the Premier League brought him to Burnley, where he joined Republic of Ireland team-mates Jeff Hendrick and Stephen Ward.\n\nBrady marked his home debut for the Clarets with a spectacular goal direct from a free-kick against eventual champions Chelsea which immediately endeared him to the Burnley fans.\n\nHe ended his first season with the Clarets having started seven games and with the platform to kick on with his Turf Moor career.\n\nInternationally, Brady has represented his country across all age levels up to the senior side, scoring Ireland’s famous late winner against Italy to take his country into the knock-out stages of Euro 2016 in France.\n\nThat earned him the Republic’s goal of the season accolade for 2016\u002F17, with Brady also being named as Ireland’s Player and Young Player of the Year.\n\nBrady started the 2017\u002F18 in superb form for the Clarets, scoring a memorable goal in a Carabao Cup win at Blackburn Rovers.\n\nThe wideman also scored what turned out to be the winner at Bournemouth as the Clarets continued their fine start to the season.\n\nSadly Brady suffered a season-ending knee injury in the next game at Leicester City at the start of December, although his contribution played a large part in laying the foundations for the Clarets' seventh-place finish and Europa League qualification.\n\nFollowing successful surgery the Irishman returned for pre-season, but a hamstring problem then delayed his Premier League return until October, 2018.\n\nIt turned out to be a stop-start campaign for Brady but he remained an important part of the squad for club and country as he signed off the 2018\u002F19 campaign on Euro 2020 qualifying duty for Ireland.\n\nInjuries and the form of Dwight McNeil on the Clarets' left flank again limited Brady's impact in 2019\u002F20.\n\nBut he did make 17 top-flight appearances to help Burnley finish in the Premier League's top 10.\n\nHe returned to action following lockdown and the Clarets triggered a contract extension to keep him at Turf Moor for a further 12

performances attracting the attention of Premier League clubs.\n\nAston Villa won the chase in August 2012 and completed a £2m deal to take Westwood to the Midlands on a four-year contract.\n\nWithin a year, Westwood had been rewarded with a new deal by manager Paul Lambert, and was a regular at the centre of Villa’s midfield. He spent four years with Villa in the Premier League, and was coveted as one of the most highly rated young players in the country.\n\nWestwood is fondly remembered at Villa Park for a crucial goal against Hull City as Villa escaped relegation in 2014.\n\nHe was instrumental in another successful relegation battle and a run to the FA Cup final in 2015 – signing a new five-year contract once safety had been assured. Despite some good individual performances, the midfielder couldn’t help Villa beat the drop in 2016 in a season of turmoil at Villa Park.\n\nWestwood remained a regular starter in the Championship for

midfield to secure their top-flight status thanks to an outstanding second half of the season.\n\nWestwood was named both players' player and supporters' Player of the Year as he topped the Clarets' Premier League assists' table and scored his first two goals for the club.\n\nThe midfielder enjoyed another outstanding season in 2019\u002F20 - missing just three Premier League games as he helped

Wood joined the Clarets in August, 2017 after signing from Leeds United on a four-year deal.\n\nThe striker moved to Turf Moor for an undisclosed record transfer fee to seal a return to the Premier League following earlier spells in the top flight with West Bromwich Albion and Leicester City.\n\nThe New Zealand international started his career in England with West Brom after impressing during a trial spell and moving over from his home country to earn a youth scholarship deal.\n\nHe graduated to the professional ranks at the Hawthorns and broke into the first team to make 27 appearances for the Baggies, helping them win promotion back to the Premier League in 2009\u002F10.\n\nHe was also loaned out to gain further senior experience in the Championship with Barnsley, Birmingham, Bristol City and Ipswich Town, as well with Brighton in League One during the 2010\u002F11 campaign when he scored eight times in 29 games to help the Seagulls win the title.\n\nDuring the 2012\u002F13 season, Wood was re-called by West Brom from his temporary stay at Millwall, where he scored 11 goals in 19 games, to make a permanent move to Leicester in January, 2013.\n\nHe hit the ground running at the King Power Stadium, scoring 11 times in 24 games to help the Foxes reach the Championship play-offs.\n\nThey missed out on promotion but the following season clinched the Championship title to regain a Premier League place.\n\nWood scored eight times, including a spectacular strike against Burnley, who also won promotion after finishing second to Leicester.\n\nWood then scored on the opening day of the 2014\u002F15 Premier League season to earn Leicester a point against Everton before spending the second half of that season out on loan at Ipswich Town.\n\nLeeds then signed the striker on a four-year deal in July 2015, with Wood scoring 13 Championship goals in his first season at Elland Road.\n\nHe then more than doubled that tally last season to finish as the Championship’s top scorer with 27 goals as Leeds just missed out on the play-offs.\n\nWood scored again on the opening day of the 2017\u002F18 season – taking his career club goal tally to 101 in 291 games – before ending his time in Yorkshire to join the Clarets as their sixth signing of the summer transfer window.\n\nInternationally, the Auckland-born striker - joint second in his country's all-time scoring list with 24 goals by the summer of 2018 - played in the 2010 World Cup in South Africa as an 18-year-old where he figured in all three of the All Whites’ three unbeaten group games.\n\nHe also became the youngest captain of his country when he led the side for the first time in November, 2014.\n\nHis first season at Turf Moor saw Wood finish as top scorer with 11 goals.\n\nDespite missing more than a third of the campaign through injury, 10 of those goals came in the Premier League as the Clarets finished seventh to secure European football.\n\nHis return from injury in March brought Wood four goals in five games and the Clarets five successive wins that were vital in propelling Burnley to a best league finish since 1974.\n\nThat secured a place in the Europa League for the Clarets, who reached the final qualifying round with Wood scoring twice during the six-game run.\n\nHe went on to enjoy another productive domestic campaign, hitting double figures in the Premier League for the second successive season.\n\nHis partnership with Ashley Barnes was crucial to the Clarets' revival in the second half of the 2018\u002F19 season with the pair sharing Burnley's top-scorer award with 13 goals each.\n\nWood was to do even better in the 2019\u002F20 season with his 14 top-flight goals making him the top scorer with his best Premier League haul.\n\nThe Kiwi became the Clarets' highet scorer in the top tier since Peter Noble in 1975\u002F76.\n\nAnd he finished the extended season with a bang with three goals in as many games as Sean Dyche's side secored only a second ever top-10 finish in the Premier League.",sponsor:{},isHtml:a}],language:i,version:aI,source:{sourceSystem:j,overwriteEnabled:a},singlePage:h,linkedIds:[{text:ov,sourceSystem:x,sourceSystemId:"60689"},{text:"wood-celeb.jpg",sourceSystem:c,sourceSystemId:"31a9a01b-6044-4942-bd81-732cc8a1bef1"},{text:l,sourceSystem:aV,sourceSystemId:v},{text:aQ,sourceSystem:aW,sourceSystemId:aS}],heroMedia:{content:{id:"60ad6742-544a-4c1b-be16-1baa1425ace3",contentType:e,title:"wood-wheeling-away-2.jpg",image:"https:\u002F\u002Fmedia-cdn.incrowdsports.com\u002F31a9a01b-6044-4942-bd81-732cc8a1bef1.jpg?crop=1244:466:nowe:0:34",sponsor:{}},title:ov,summary:"Chris

secured the signature of former Brighton and Hove Albion striker Ashley Barnes on a three-and-a-half-year deal in January 2014.\n\nJust five months after his arrival, the Clarets clinched promotion to the Premier League, with Barnes scoring the first goal in a 2-0 win Wigan at Turf Moor that guaranteed going up and earned him the goal-of-the-season award.\n\nHe scored five Premier League goals in 2015\u002F16 but suffered a serious knee injury on the final day at Aston Villa - a setback that ruled him out for most of the 2015\u002F16 Championship campaign.\n\nHe made his return to the Clarets’ side against former employers Brighton & Hove Albion in April, before starting in a 2-1 victory over Birmingham City at St Andrew's.\n\nHis first goal in 20 months came when he scored a dramatic late winner against Crystal Palace in November, 2016 – one of six Premier League goals the striker scored as Sean Dyche’s side finished 16th in the table.\n\nBarnes had begun his career at local club Paulton Rovers before moving into the Football League with Plymouth Argyle on an 18-month contract in March, 2007.\n\nBarnes found first-team opportunities hard to come by at Argyle and was loaned out to Oxford United and then Salisbury City.\n\nHe enjoyed further loan spells with Eastbourne Borough in 2008 and Torquay United two years later, before subsequently joining League One side Brighton, initially on a season-long loan, scoring on his debut against Tranmere Rovers.\n\nIn July 2010, Barnes joined the Seagulls on a permanent basis for an undisclosed fee, signing a two-year contract.\n\nIn April 2011, Barnes scored the decisive goal in a 4-3 home victory over Dagenham and Redbridge, which confirmed Brighton’s promotion to the Championship.\n\nHe was then Brighton’s leading scorer in 2011\u002F12 with 14 goals in all competitions to help secure their place in England’s second tier and scored a total of 53 goals in 170 appearances for the Seagulls before making the move to Turf Moor.\n\nThe 2017\u002F18 season was a major success for Barnes as the striker hit double figures, with nine goals in the Premier League helping the Clarets to their best league finish for 44 years.\n\nHis run of six goals in eight games from the end of February was vital to Burnley's success in securing a place in the Europa League for 2018\u002F19 and saw him join Sam Vokes as the only Claret to score in four Premier Legaue games in a row.\n\nHis stunning overhead kick at West Bromwich Albion was a goal-of-the-season contender and in March, 2018, Barnes' enduring value to the squad saw the striker sign a new contract running until June, 2021.\n\nAfter a slow start to the 2018\u002F19 season, Barnes went on to enjoy his best year yet in a Burnley shirt as a talisman for the team.\n\nHis 12 Premier League goals brought him his highest tally as he continued to be the scourge of top-notch defences.\n\nThirteen goals in total made him joint leading scorer with Chris Wood, with Barnes' nine goals in the second half of the season pivotal to Sean Dyche's side staying in the Premier League for a fourth successive season.\n\nBarnes then started the 2019\u002F20 season in flying form with four goals in his first three games.\n\nUnfortunately, a hernia problem was to stall his momentum following a couple more goals in November.\n\nAnd after finally giving in to surgery, the striker didn't feature again during the season after New Year's

The priority at that time will be for current season ticket holders to get the opportunity to attend, until such time that the stadium opens up enough to allow for general admission sales. If we are allowed to open to a more significant numbers of fans we will, of course, try and ensure you also receive a priority before general admission sales. \n \n**If I request a refund, how long will it take?**\nIf you have an online profile with the club and choose to take the funds from your ‘OnAccount’, the funds should be with you between 3-5 working days. If you are not aware of your online profile you may need to reset your details using your Clarets Number. For assistance please email [ticketoffice@burnleyfc.com](mailto:ticketoffice@burnleyfc.com)\n \n**I currently pay for my season ticket via direct debit. If I request a refund, will the DD payment option be available for the 2021\u002F2022 season?**\nThere is a huge amount of uncertainty which affects the normal planning for tickets here at Turf Moor. While we cannot at this time 100% guarantee that a 'normal' direct debit option will be available for the 2021\u002F2022 season we will do everything we can to ensure that there is a suitable 'pay-over-time' option for supporters. We understand and want to continue to offer supporters the most convenient option for them to pay for a season ticket.\n\n**I pay for my ST via Direct Debit. I do not want a refund but would like to pause my monthly payments. Can I do this?**\nYes. However, please be aware that all payments would have to be caught up if you would like your seat automatically renewed for the 2021\u002F2022 season. There will be a form you need to fill in on the OnAccount page which allow you to request a pause of your future payments.\n \n**If I choose to keep the funds for my season ticket ‘OnAccount’ will there be anything extra to pay going in to the 2021\u002F2022 season?**\nNo, by paying for a 2020\u002F2021 season now you are effectively guaranteeing your seat for the lowest possible price for the 2021\u002F2022 season.\n\n**I would like my monies back for the 2020\u002F21 season, but I have every intention of coming back to the Turf in the 2021\u002F22 season. When can I renew and secure my seat again?**\nIf you choose not to attend the 2020\u002F21 season and have no monies in your account after we have refunded you, we intend to open a short renewals period pre 21\u002F22 season, which will allow previous season ticket holders to resecure their 19\u002F20 season seat. The date of this window will be determined by the Government’s decision regarding the return to the stadiums in the coming months.\n\n**I chose not to renew in the Early Bird period for 20\u002F21 due to the uncertainty surrounding the season. Can I still retain my seat for the 21\u002F22 campaign, purchase a season ticket now, and is it possible for me to be entered into a potential ticket ballot?**\nWe want to reassure you that your seat will be available to renew. We also fully appreciate that your choice not to renew may have been based upon the uncertainty of the upcoming season back in the early bird renewal window (for 2020\u002F21). In such cases we would ask supporters to contact the ticket office team, preferably by email, and provide an outline of your request and we can talk you through your options on a case-by-case basis. Please contact [ticketoffice@burnleyfc.com](mailto:ticketoffice@burnleyfc.com)\n \n**I chose not to renew in the Early bird period for 2020\u002F21. Will you re-sell my seat this season?**\nIf and when we are permitted to welcome supporters back to Turf Moor in the 2020\u002F21 season, it's anticipated it will be in much reduced numbers and will be by strict adherence to social distancing policies. In these circumstances, no supporter will be able to retain or request their ‘usual seat’.  So it may be that your usual seat could be allocated to another supporter on a match-by-match basis in the 2020\u002F21 season, This is will a temporary measure and will not affect your ability to secure your 2021\u002F22 season ticket    \n\n**Will the prices for 2021\u002F2022 season tickets be frozen again?**\nWhile we are proud to have been able to keep season ticket prices frozen for the past seven seasons, in the current climate we cannot guarantee this will continue. This is reviewed on an annual basis and will be looked at again as we approach the 2021\u002F2022 season. By paying your frozen price now you are guaranteeing you will have no higher price to pay for a new season ticket for the 2021\u002F22 season.\n\n**I have paid for my own, plus my two children’s season tickets on the same card. Do I need to go into each account to request refunds?**\nAnswer updated 2nd November \nYes, you will need to go into each account in order to access the OnAccount as they are personal for each supporter. Multiple accounts can be attached to the same email address to make this process easier.\n\nHowever moving forward we would strongly advise for all supporters to have their own email address as this may be required in the future to be able to email contactless ticket access to Turf Moor. \n\n**I have a zero-value season ticket (for example a personal assistant or child's ticket). Do I need to do anything to this account?**\nNo action is needed on a zero-value season ticket. We will reserve the seat as normal. We do ask that if you intend not to renew for the 2021\u002F2022 season to please let us know so we can put this seat back on sale at the appropriate time.\n\n**I have been given a season ticket as a gift, or someone else pays for my season ticket. Can I ask for a refund to my bank account?**\nNo, refunds will be processed to the card you have as your ‘saved card’ in your online ticket profile.\n\n**How long do I have to decide whether to take a refund or not. Will you impose a deadline?**\nA deadline will need to be set to end the refund process. However, currently we have not set a fixed date.\n\n**How do I check and or update my card details on my clarets account?**\nLogin to the ticket website [**HERE**](https:\u002F\u002Ftickets.burnleyfc.com\u002FPagesPublic\u002FHome\u002FHome.aspx) and click on the ‘My Saved Cards’ option or contact the ticket office team: [ticketoffice@burnleyfc.com](mailto:ticketoffice@burnleyfc.com) \n\n**I’ve chosen to cancel my direct debit payments already so I am not currently a season ticket holder or my situation isn’t covered above, what advice can you give?

Points will not be added for previous purchases at the club, or if you forget your TeamCard registered SeasonCard. \n\n**How can I check how many TeamCard points I have?**\n\nRegister your TeamCard registered SeasonCard - you will then be shown your TeamCard points total. \n\nYour total points will be available online at www.myteamcard.co.uk once you have registered your TeamCard. \n\n**What if I forget my TeamCard registered SeasonCard on a matchday?**\n\n**Correct for 2019\u002F20 season** - you can get a replacement paper ticket for that game from the Turf Moor ticket office, who will then deactivate your TeamCard for that game.\n \nPlease note: there is a £5 charge for this\n\n**What if I lose my TeamCard registered SeasonCard?**\n\n**Correct for 2019\u002F20 season** - Please contact the Turf Moor Ticket Office as soon as possible who will deactivate your TeamCard registered SeasonCard so it cannot be used by anyone else. A replacement TeamCard registered SeasonCard is £25. \n\n**Can someone else use my TeamCard registered SeasonCard to enter Turf Moor on matchday?**\n \nCards are transferable within the same age category and in lower categories.\nYou cannot transfer the card to a higher age \u002Fprice bracket unless you pay the upgrade payments, where applicable, as outlined.\nThere are no downgrade refunds. \nThe card remains the responsibility of the owner. \nFree under 10 tickets in the Family stand are not transferable. \nFor queries, please contact the Turf Moor ticket office on a non-matchday on 01282 446800. \n\n**How do I upgrade my TeamCard registered SeasonCard for a game?**\n**Correct for season 2019\u002F21** - Season ticket holders and individual matchday purchasers may ‘upgrade’ their seat during the season for example (under 12 to adult). This can be done before to the game by presenting your card or ticket at the ticket office, based at Turf Moor.\nThe deadline to complete this upgrade is 1 hour before kick-off.\nWe are unable to complete upgrades over the telephone.\nTickets cannot be upgraded online.\n\n**What happens if I am rejected entry to Turf Moor?**\n\nIf the unlikely situation occurs where there is a technical fault with your TeamCard registered seasonCard, you will be asked to return to the ticket office who will provide you with a paper ticket to gain entry. \n\nFans are reminded that to attempt to enter Turf Moor using someone else’s card, without the club's permission or under the incorrect price band, is a fraudulent offence.\n \nAnyone who would like to upgrade their Teamcard registered SeasonCard must do by close of business the day before matchday.\n \nAnyone found to be attempting to enter Turf Moor under the incorrect price band on a matchday will be asked to report to the Turf Moor Ticket Office, pay the full cost for the correct price band season or matchday ticket plus an additional charge of £5. Until this process is complete, you will not be granted access to Turf Moor. \n\n**Do TeamCard points expire and if so, when?**\n \nFrom 1st July 2019, you can begin collecting TeamCard points for the 2019\u002F2020 season, which will in turn collect up until 30th June 2020. \nAt this point, you will have up until 1st April 2021 to use your points before they expire* \n\n***Update Feb 2021** - please note that the Club will extend the expiry date of the TeamCard points gathered in the 2019\u002F20 season beyond the 1st April 2021 deadline mentioned above.  We recognise that supporters have had restrictions placed upon the ability to use these points so we want to reassure all supporters that we will give you ample chance to use these points.  Once we have further information regarding the extended expiry dates we will publish an update on this webpage.  If you have further questions regarding expiry dates then please contact us. \n\nYour total points will be available online at www.myteamcard.co.uk once you have registered your TeamCard. \n \n**What can I do with a TeamCard keyfob?**\n \nYou are unable to gain access to the turnstiles with your TeamCard keyfob.\nYou will still need to have either a TeamCard registered SeasonCard or a matchday ticket with barcode.\n\nTeamCard Fobs are available from the Clarets Store and the ticket office when you make a purchase. The keyfob allows you build up points with TeamCard, which can then be used to discount future purchases at the Clarets Store or from the cost of a season ticket. \n \nFor current TeamCard registered SeasonCard holders, fobs can also be linked to your current TeamCard registered SeasonCard and be used in its place when making purchases at the Clarets Store.\n \n -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n**Please note: February 2021**\n\nBurnley Football Club is in the process of reveiwing some of the use of this system in the stadium and store (use of the plastic cards).

The Blue Light Card aimed to provide high street discounts on a national basis and provide all members of all services with an equal chance to save no matter what job role or service that they work for.\n\nThe first website launched in September 2008 with 100 discounts available to members and provided purely online discounts. In January 2009 the High Street Card was launched providing members with a physical card option that they could take in to store and save directly on goods and services. This again developed when in 2009 the Blue Light Card Cashback scheme launched allowing members to shop at online stores and receive money back as a reward for doing so into a Blue Light Card account. This opened the door to many retailers and saw 400 cashback offers go live at launch.\n\nIn July 2009 the Blue Light Card was proudly sponsored by Blockbuster Entertainment who provided High Street Card members with 10 free movie rentals. This saw a surge in membership and gave members real value for money with the Blue Light Card High Street Card. This offer was extended in July 2010 and still runs today with every High Street Card – an offer not available to the general public.\n\nIn August 2010 Blue Light Card radically improved its services and approach. With thanks to sponsorship from Three Mobile the Blue Light Card was able to expand and give 130,000 High Street Cards away for free to members of the Emergency Services and NHS across the UK.\n\nSeptember 2010 the Blue Light Card opened its doors to the UK's Armed Forces Personnel and recognised the important work that they do for the UK alongside the Emergency Services and NHS. The Blue Light Card recognised the work of the UK Coastguard service and Prison Service and extended its benefits to these services.\n\nThe Blue Light Card wants to make sure that it is benefiting the entire Emergency Services, NHS and Armed Forces.

The range of community safety risk is extensive and changing quickly, requiring us to allocate resources on the basis of risk and reducing risk as far as possible.\n\nWe define the extent of risk as being the likelihood that something will happen, multiplied by the severity of the consequences if it does. This means that we focus our efforts on:\n\nreducing the chance of fire happening through prevention work ;\nrestricting the impact if it does through protection work. ;\nproviding a quick and professional response to emergencies to mitigate the consequences if all else fails.\n \n\n**‘Making Lancashire Safer’**\n‘Making Lancashire Safer’ is the simple commitment we give to the people we serve and defines the overall purpose that our staff are working to achieve.  It also illustrates that we are increasingly working with a variety of partners including local authorities, police, primary care trusts and care providers to bring about better results than could be achieved by working by ourselves.\n\n**Contact:**\nChris Waring\nBurnley Fire Station, Belvedere Road,\nBurnley, Lancashire, BB10 3AA\n01282 423240\nwww.lancsfirerescue.org.uk\u002F\n",sponsor:{},isHtml:a}],title:"Lancashire Fire & Rescue"},{id:"2e55ca5b-187b-40e7-a280-18b4517fd105",children:[{id:"524bfe10-1a1e-414e-9675-5459a4465d44",contentType:e,image:"https:\u002F\u002Fmedia-cdn.incrowdsports.com\u002F4e6adffc-092e-4da1-822d-a34ef3214ead.png?crop=230:129:nowe:81:0",sponsor:{}},{id:"610a8d79-59eb-45e1-8070-558ff9f00e2d",contentType:d,content:"**FOOTBALL APPRECIATION**\n\nIf you love football join the Football Appreciation society where you can meet like minded people.

If you sleep deeply, your body and mind are much healthier, and, therefore, you tend to be less stressed and happier.\n\nOver the past few months, the lucky players in the Burnley squad have been trialling the very latest advancement in sleep technology…the Sealy Hybrid bed. This combines a newly developed, unique fusion of memory foam with a new elasticised gel which creates Geltex. This offers all the benefits and support of memory foam but it is now springy, so supremely comfortable. This is set over thousands of specially designed standard pocket and mini pocket springs and enclosed in material which contains Adaptive - special fibres which wick away moisture and help regulate the body’s temperature, even through the bed linen, so the sleeper rests in a perfect temperature, comfortable throughout both the summer and winter.\n\nAs we all know, the Burnley guys have played really well this season and have now been rewarded with promotion back up to the Premier League…so they can spend the summer watching the World Cup and getting some well earned rest…and perhaps dreaming on their wonderful new beds of what they can achieve next season...\n\nNeil Robinson, Sealy’s Marketing Director says “Sealy’s mission is for everyone to be a deeper sleeper and have sweet dreams. We’ve been delighted to help support Burnley and are thrilled they’ve been promoted. Hopefully they’re all be dreaming of big success in the Premier League next season on their new beds.”\n\nMark Howard is Head of Sports Science at the now newly promoted Club. Prior to joining the Clarets, he worked at other Premier League clubs such as Newcastle, Fulham and Blackburn, and is a firm believer in the importance of deep sleep as part of looking after the health and wellbeing of the playing squad at the Club.\n\nAs Mark says “We all lead such busy lives these days that getting a good night’s sleep tends to slip down the agenda, but just as exercise and nutrition are essential for good health, so is sleep. The quality of our sleep directly affects the quality of our daily lives, including mental sharpness, productivity, emotional balance, creativity, energy, and even our weight. No other activity delivers so many benefits with so little effort! As far as the footballers under my care are concerned, ensuring they get plenty of sleep,especially before a match, is crucial. And if there is an evening fixture, I always recommend the guys go to bed in the afternoon for some serious shut eye so they are at the top of their game for the kick off later.”\n\n“When we sleep our body and brain don’t actually shut off. We have light sleep phases and deeper ones. While we sleep in the deeper phases at night, our brain stays busy, overseeing an internal maintenance schedule that keeps us running in top condition. This helps the body repair itself and build energy for the day ahead - our muscles and tissues recover, our immune system gets a boost and all the information we have absorbed during the day gets consolidated in our memory. Without enough hours of this type of restorative sleep, we won’t function, work, learn, create, and communicate at an effective level; and, as far as sports people are concerned, they certainly won’t perform at their peak level.\n\n“You’ll know if you’re in deeper sleep as, if you’re woken while in this phase, you’ll feel disoriented for a few minutes. So, to help you get into these important deeper sleeping phases, you need to ensure your bed is doing what it should - being comfortable, yet at the same time supporting your body and spine in correct alignment so you don’t toss and turn at night and wake with aches and pains and not feel refreshed and raring to go at the start of a new day.”\n\nAs Mark says “The temperature, support and comfort of your bed is so important. These brand new beds from Sealy have been great and the guys in the team love them….and so do I if I know they are getting a really good night’s sleep…..Burnley FC have now joined the ranks of Sealy Deeper Sleepers.”\n\nAre you one yet???\n\n**Contact:**\nNeil Robinson\nPrestige Beds, 3 Royle Road,\nBurnley, Lancashire, BB12 0EL\nsealy.co.uk",sponsor:{},isHtml:a}],title:"Sealy"},{id:"323cd89f-014b-4063-90e7-74d029e2ccbe",children:[{id:"c7c4cae7-966e-4d67-8d8b-8644840d374b",contentType:e,image:"https:\u002F\u002Fmedia-cdn.incrowdsports.com\u002F79d86d39-ae69-43fe-9c4d-ac2ad623880c.png?crop=200:112:nowe:0:44",sponsor:{}},{id:"cc0f0ce7-2a0a-40a7-ada8-7b326ac92e3e",contentType:d,content:"Senior Aerospace Weston, located in Lancashire, England, is a leading supplier of a wide range of complex precision machined components, and sub- assemblies for original equipment manufacturers (OEMs’) predominantly in the commercial aviation market sector.

Burnley Football Club reserves the right to refuse Direct Debit applications. In the event that an application to pay for a Season Ticket using the Direct Debit Scheme is refused the applicant must pay for their Season Ticket in full at the point the Direct Debit application is refused\n\n3. The Direct Debit Scheme operates on a recurring basis. Instalments will be automatically taken for a Season Ticket each season. Supporters who do not wish to retain their Season Ticket for the following season via the Direct Debit Scheme must inform Burnley Football Club before March 1 of the current season by telephoning us on 01282 446800 (Option 3), writing to us at Ticket Office, Burnley Football Club, Harry Potts Way, Burnley, BB10 4BX, or directdebit@burnleyfc.com, or informing us in person at the Turf Moor Ticket Office\n\n4. The cost of the current Season Tickets can be found by clicking here and will be payable by twelve equal instalments from April (in the year of the season start) until March (in the year the season ends).

The first monthly instalment will be taken on 25 April (in the year the season starts) from the account details given to us at the time of purchase and each subsequent instalment will be taken on the 25th of each month.

Once payment of the missed instalment(s) (including any default administration charges) has been received in full, so the account is up to date, the account will be unfrozen and all Season Tickets and Customer Accounts reactivated.\n\n9. Any supporter who has two outstanding instalments on their account at any time will be contacted and given seven days notice to make the relevant payment to update their Customer Account. Failure to make the relevant payment within seven days will result in the Season Ticket being cancelled.

TeamCard points will not collected when purchasing season tickets or matchday tickets at the current time. \n\nFor every £1 you spend on retail items, you will receive 10 TeamCard points. \n\nWe have select ‘TeamCard matchdays’ and events throughout the season when additional TeamCard points can be collected - these will be advertised on our website.\n\n**Spending TeamCard points:**\n\nOnce you have collected TeamCard points, you can choose to spend these to discount your next purchase at Turf Moor reatil store. \n\nEvery point is worth 1p to spend. \n\nTeamCard points can be spent at the Turf Moor ticket office towards the cost of your season ticket renewal, or at either of the Clarets Stores against retail items.  \n\nFor example, if you had 1000 points (£10) you could spend these to reduce the cost of your next season ticket. \n\nPlease note: TeamCard points cannot be used against individual matchdays unless otherwise stated. \n\nWhat your collected points are worth:\n \n | Points Collected |   | Spend Value |\n|------------------|---|-------------|\n| 100              |   | £1          |\n| 500              |   | £5          |\n| 1000             |   | £10         |\n| 2000             |   | £20         |\n| 5000             |   | £50         |\n| 10000            |   | £100        |\n| 25000            |   | £250        |\n\n**When can I collect TeamCard points?**\n\nYou can only collect TeamCard points at the time of purchase by having your card scanned at the till-point. Points will not be added for previous purchases at the club, or if you forget your TeamCard. \n\n**How can I check how many TeamCard points I have?**\n\nRegister your card online  - you will then be shown your TeamCard points total.\n\nYour total points and their expiry date will be available online at www.myteamcard.co.uk once you have registered your TeamCard.\n\n**What if I forget my TeamCard registered seasonCard on a matchday?**\n\nYou can get a replacement paper ticket for that game from the Turf Moor ticket office, who will then deactivate your TeamCard for that game.\n \nPlease note: there is a £5 charge for this. \n\n**What if I lose my TeamCard registered seasonCard?**\n\nPlease contact the Turf Moor Ticket Office as soon as possible who will deactivate your card so it cannot be used by anyone else. A replacement TeamCard is £25. \n\n**Can someone else use my TeamCard registered seasonCard to enter Turf Moor on matchday?**\n \nCards are transferable within the same age category and in lower categories.\nYou cannot transfer the card to a higher age \u002Fprice bracket unless you pay the upgrade payments, where applicable, as outlined.\nThere are no downgrade refunds. \nCards remain the responsibility of the owner. \nFree under 10 tickets in the Family stand are not transferable. \nFor queries, please contact the Turf Moor ticket office on a non-matchday on 01282 446800. \n\n**How do I upgrade my TeamCard registered seasonCard for a game?**\nSeasonCards and individual matchday purchasers may ‘upgrade’ their seat during the season for example (under 12 to adult). This can be done before to the game by presenting your ticket or seasonCard at the ticket office, based at Turf Moor.\n\nThe deadline to complete this upgrade is 1 hour before kick-off.\nWe are unable to complete upgrades over the telephone.\nTickets cannot be upgraded online.\n\n**What happens if I am refused entry to Turf Moor?**\nIf the unlikely situation occurs where there is a technical fault with your card, you will be asked to return to the ticket office who will provide you with a paper ticket to gain entry. \n\nFans are reminded that to attempt to enter Turf Moor using someone else’s card, without the club's permission or under the incorrect price band, is a fraudulent offence.\n \nAnyone who would like to upgrade their ticket category (ie child to an adult) must do by close of business the day before matchday.\n \nAnyone found to be attempting to enter Turf Moor under the incorrect price band on a matchday will be asked to report to the Turf Moor Ticket Office, pay the full cost for the correct price band season or matchday ticket plus an additional charge of £5. Until this process is complete, you will not be granted access to Turf Moor. \n\n**Do TeamCard points expire and if so, when?**\n \nFrom 1st July 2019, you can begin collecting TeamCard points for the 2019\u002F2020 season, which will in turn collect up until 30th June 2020. \nAt this point, you will have up until 1st April 2021 to use your points before they expire.\n\nYour total points and their expiry date will be available online at www.myteamcard.co.uk once you have registered your TeamCard. \n\n***Update Feb 2021** - please note that the Club will extend the expiry date of the TeamCard points gathered in the 2019\u002F20 season beyond the 1st April 2021 deadline mentioned above.

Once we have further information regarding the extended expiry dates we will publish an update on this webpage.  If you have further questions regarding expiry dates then please contact us. \n\n**What can I do with a TeamCard keyfob?**\n \nTeamCard keyfobs cannot be used as a form of entry into Turf Moor on matchdays. You will still need to have either a TeamCard registered seasonCard or a matchday ticket with barcode.\n\nTeamCard fobs are available from the Clarets Store and the ticket office when you make a purchase. The keyfob allows you build up points, much like with a TeamCard registered SeasonCard.

He later served as Managing Director and the Global Head of Sales Securities Services, overseeing a multibillion-dollar division.\n\nAlan left Citi to found ALK Capital in 2019 with the ambition to acquire a football club with fellow investors and apply the best-practice learnings in business and sports management to this field. \n\nAlan splits his time between New York and London with his wife Kristen and, having grown up in Southern California, enjoys surfing and snowboarding. He has three daughters whose initials make up the ALK in ALK Capital. \n",sponsor:{},isHtml:a},{id:"96d55879-d49f-44c8-9a08-850a51b94c7e",contentType:e,image:"https:\u002F\u002Fmedia-cdn.incrowdsports.com\u002Fb6050d56-51e6-4113-97a3-56f94e2c8359.jpg?crop=6643:3737:nowe:0:322",sponsor:{}},{id:"4c75117e-eae8-4cc4-9801-db468ce88759",contentType:d,content:"**Stuart Hunt - Director**\n\nHaving achieved success both in financial services for JPMorgan and a variety of hedge funds on Wall Street, Stuart Hunt has also built a restaurant business which operates across 40+ locations in the US and employs nearly 1000 members of staff. \n\nHaving excelled at lacrosse in college, Stuart has retained a keen interest in sports and the business of sport and joined Alan Pace as a partner of ALK Capital bringing his expertise in investing and operating high-returning businesses across a variety of industries.\n",sponsor:{},isHtml:a},{id:"9236cb62-2689-4bb2-ba30-713e46f6bb3f",contentType:e,image:"https:\u002F\u002Fmedia-cdn.incrowdsports.com\u002Feebe4449-178a-4db7-99e7-3bf5cc97f56f.jpg?crop=3857:2892:nowe:0:372",sponsor:{}},{id:"eacafc93-484a-4505-a21c-c4ef116ea09f",contentType:d,content:"**Mike Smith - Director**\n\nAs an experienced legal professional Mike Smith has represented some of the largest companies and most successful entrepreneurs in the world in the areas of financial operations, strategic positioning, complex problem solving and high-profile crisis management.\n\nEnjoying a rapid rise in the legal industry, named in the ‘Top 40 under 40’ by the American Legal Media, Mike spent 20 years at New York-based Brewer Attorneys & Counselors – becoming their youngest person to be made partner – before moving into the world of start-ups and joining ALK Capital. \n\nWithin sports Mike has advised American Football leagues, professional sports franchise owners, and served as Strategic Advisor and Counsel in development of the world’s largest ice centre.\n",sponsor:{},isHtml:a},{id:"58a321b7-e08b-46bb-bc88-f4802f5fde16",contentType:e,image:"https:\u002F\u002Fmedia-cdn.incrowdsports.com\u002Ff9f04911-2f05-4393-bcea-62f7e0697e20.jpg?crop=2000:1500:nowe:0:410",sponsor:{}},{id:"f1d6b00b-8650-4d99-b1f3-70327b9cf3f2",contentType:d,content:"**Dave Checketts - Director**\n\nA leading figure in sport and entertainment for nearly four decades, Dave Checketts brings a wealth of experience in growing successful sports franchises, stadia and hospitality business to Burnley.

In this case you may enter the general admission ballot.  \n\nIf you only hold a complimentary personal assistant's ticket, you would need to speak with the ticket office to discuss your individual situation and they will advise further - please do this as soon as you can. \n\nTo do this, please [email our ticket office] (mailto:ticketoffice@burnleyfc.com). \n\n**We have been successful in the ballot and been allocated a ticket for a match, however the registered disabled supporter I would have attended with doesn’t feel well on matchday or have decided not to attend last minute.

The ticket was allocated in the accessible stand, hence must only be used when accompanying the registered disabled supporter.  \n\nIf you wish to discuss this with us, please [email our Supporter\u002FDisability Liaison Officer](mailto:slo@burnleyfc.com), Anita Goodenough. \n\nPlease contact Anita prior to attending a game.  \n\n**I am my child’s personal assistant and our support bubble includes another child - can they attend with us?\n(a party of three - disabled supporter, parent caregiver and a child)**\n\nYes - if you have to attend the match to assist and care for both of your children, we would encourage you to attend in this support bubble for a matchday.  \n\nPlease make sure that all tickets are linked via Friends and Family, then when you apply for the ballot, they will be available to add to your party.  \n\nPlease [email our Supporter\u002FDisability Liaison Officer](mailto:slo@burnleyfc.com), Anita Goodenough, to confirm if you are in this situation, as we would need to be made aware of any groupings of three or over to help with ticket allocations.\n\n**2019\u002F20 season I attended the accessible stands as a third or fourth member of a group, but I am not a registered PA for the disabled season ticket holder. Can I still apply for the accessible ballot with the disabled supporter?**\n\nWe always want to maximise the amount of registered disabled supporters positions we can use in the accessible stands. \n\nIf you are able to attend in general admission, we would ask that you consider to enter the general admission ballot. \n\n**I have two disabled supporters and two personal assistants in my party - can we apply as one group?**\n\nYes - please do if you wish to be seated as one group.  \n\nPlease make sure that all your party are linked via Friends and Family, that at least 1 supporter is 'web ready' and use that supporters account to apply for the ballot for all four of you.\n\n**I’m in a social bubble with other family members one being a registered disabled supporter who uses the accessible stand can we apply as a group of 3 or 4 as a one off?**\n\nWe recognise that you are in a social bubble with your party, but we encourage you to prioritise support bubbles in the first instance and we would wish to offer the maximum amount of places to our registered disabled users first.  \n\nIf there is a low take up in the accessible stands, we may be able to consider larger party sizes, but only strictly by prior request. This request can be made via [our Supporter\u002FDisability Liaison Officer](mailto:slo@burnleyfc.com), Anita Goodenough. \n\n**Will you be using the pitchside platforms as part of the balloted allocations for the accessible stand?**\n\nYes - to maximise the potential numbers of accessible places we can offer, it may be possible that you are offered a position on one of the pitchside platforms.  \n\nThe idea is to offer multiple levels or viewing positions for our registered disabled supporters.\n\n**If I was using the SE stand, is it possible I could be allocated the NE stand?**\n\nWhere at all possible, we will seat you in the stand that you used last season. However, we cannot guarantee a certain stand, level or seating position.  We will have a much reduced capacity and an anticipated high demand.  Initially we may not open both stands.  We ask for flexibility when considering your seating options. \n\n**What if I have a specific practical need on a matchday, will every seating position offer this?**\n\nAll positions in the NE or SE stand and both platforms have the same step-free access, access to toilet facilities and are all pitch-facing.  \n\nIf you have a specific concern regarding this, please let us know prior to applying for the ballot by emailing our Supporter\u002FDisability Liaison Officer, Anita Goodenough, on [slo@burnleyfc.com](mailto:slo@burnleyfc.com). \n\n**Do both the NE and SE stands offer changing places?**\n\nThis facility is only available in the NE stand.  \n\nIf you need to use this facility on matchday and you are successful in the ballot, please email Anita Goodenough on [slo@burnleyfc.com](mailto:slo@burnleyfc.com).  We will make sure that this will be available on matchday.\n\n**My seat last season was on an upper level - will I be given an upper level again?**\n\nWe recognise the viewing positions in the two stands do differ slightly due to angle or level of the deck, however  we cannot guarantee a level just upon preference of position or view.  \n\nWe will try to allocate you as much as we can to the areas you were seated last season. \n\nIf you have a practical, sensory of physical needs, [please get in touch](mailto:slo@burnleyfc.com).\n\n**I pay a different price for an upper level position - if I am given a lower level, how will I be charged?**\n\nPlease be assured that we will leave no-one out of pocket - if you are allocated a lower priced position, you will be charged accordingly for that price bracket, pro rata.\n\n**My party contains a supporter with sensory needs.  I’m concerned that we may be allocated a different area which could could cause extra anxiety for our party.**\n\nWe can look to arrange a prematch visit to the seating area if this would help alleviate any concerns.  \n\nFor more information, [please email our Supporter\u002FDisability Liaison Officer, Anita Goodenough.](mailto:slo@burnleyfc.com). \n\n**I use an agency for my personal assistant – or I may consider to do so to enable me to attend as my previous PA is unable to assist me.  How can I let you know who my personal assistant is if I only find out on matchday?**\n\nWe would need to know the personal assistant’s name and details, just as any supporter entering the stadium on a matchday they would need to complete all the necessary checks prior to accessing the stadium. \n\nIn this instance, we can arrange to take these details on a matchday over the phone, and we would need an email address for them.  \n\nWe would ask if you expect this to be the situation, to let us know as as soon as possible, and definitely before you arrive at the stadium. \n\n**Does my child or a personal assistant (of a supporter registered as a disabled supporter) count towards the group of six limit?**\n\nYes - every person in attendance will count towards the group total of six.\n\n \n**I am not a season ticket holder in the accessible stands but I feel I do have accessibility needs that would qualify me to use these stands. What advice would you give?**\n\nWe have a waiting list for people who will be placed into the accessible stands. \n\nPlease contat our [Supporter\u002FDisability Liaison Officer, Anita Goodenough](mailto:slo@burnleyfc.com) and our [Accessible Ticketing Supervisor, Dane Wilson](mailto:Dane.Wilson@burnleyfc.com) to outline your request.  \n\nWe will consider your request, but due to high demand, we may not be able to fulfil it this season.\n\n**I have a temporary accessibility need (i.e. had an operation or have a cast on my leg \u002Farm) - can I use the accessible stands for reduced capacity matches?**\n\nWe may not be able to accommodate you in the accessible stands on a matchday and we ask if you do have a specific requirement that you discuss it with us.\n\nWe will ask you to indicate that you require an 'easy access seat' when you enter the ballot, and a member of our access team will call you to discuss your needs if you are successful in the ballot.\n\n**Will the accessible stands be used for supporters who are not registered as disabled?**\n\nWe will be issuing tickets to current season ticket holder in the accessible stands as a priority in the accessible ballots. \n\n**Do you have a waiting list to be moved into the accessible stands on a reduced capacity matchday?**\n\nWe are unable to place any supporter on a waiting list due to an expected high demand for tickets.  If we have a low demand from our current registered disabled season ticket holders, and all places are not taken up, we would consider to release these places by increasing the amount of general admission places. \n\nWe will advise supporters if we intend to do this.\n\n**I have a medical condition that means that my temperature sometimes can be high - would I be excluded on a matchday from attending?**\n\nIf you have a medical condition that you think we need to be aware of, or that may present as similar symptoms to COVID-19, we would ask you to contact us prior to the accessible ballot to make us aware and we can give individual advice.\n\nYou can email Our [Supporter\u002FDisability Liaison Officer](mailto:slo@burnleyfc.com), Anita Goodenough, to discuss your options. \n\n**My question is not covered \u002F I want to check you have my correct details - who should I contact?**\n\nPlease email your general or matchday queries to our Supporter\u002FDisability Liaison Officer, Anita Goodenough, on [slo@burnleyfc.com](mailto:slo@burnleyfc.com). \n\nIf you want to check on the details on your ticketing account, ask about being 'web ready' or have any finance\u002Fpayments questions, please [email our ticket office](mailto:ticketoffice@burnleyfc.com).

We commit to providing open and timely communications to our supporters. \n\nIf you have any individual questions that are not covered here, please [email our Supporter\u002FDisability Liaison Officer](slo@burnleyfc.com), Anita Goodenough for general enquiries.  \n\nPlease [email our ticket office](mailto:ticketoffice@burnleyfc.com) if your enquiry relates to payments or your Clarets account details.    \n \n**I decided to take the offer to add points onto my card instead of a cash refund for the matches I could not attend in the 2020\u002F19 season. I now want to use them instore, but you are closed currently can the expiry date of my pionts total be extended so I am able to use them when you reopen?**\n\n *Update Feb 2021 - please note that the Club will extend the expiry date of the TeamCard points gathered in the 2019\u002F20 season beyond the 1st April 2021 deadline mentioned on our TeamCard information pages.  We recognise that supporters have had restrictions placed upon the ability to use these points so we want to reassure all supporters that we will give you ample chance to use these points.  Once we have further information regarding the extended expiry dates we will publish an update on this webpage.  If you have further questions regarding expiry dates then please contact us\n\n So yes you will be able to use them throughout 2021, if you have a sepcific question please contact us on [email our Supporter\u002FDisability Liaison Officer](slo@burnleyfc.com)\n\n**As the Clarets store is currently closed can I use my Teamcard \u002F retail points online to purchase items?**\nThis is a service the Club wants to provide for supporters and we are working with our partners to enable this as soon as practicable.

You will be asked to agree to this in the sales process.  \n\nThis will give practical guidance for a matchday.\n\n**What does a supporter code of conduct cover?**\n\nThis will contain information on what to prepare for before attending the match and how we ask that you behave in the stadium – for example: arrival and departure times, bags in the stadium, catering, stewarding, mask wearing, ticketing options, your health and hygiene, social distancing in the stadium and what facilities we may not be operating for those reduced capacity matches.  \n\nWe will also produce a revised matchday guide to allow you to plan in advance for your matchday. \n\n**Will you tell me which entrance I need to use on matchday? **\n\nWe will ask you to enter the stadium either via the entrance next to the Clarets Store or the entrance on Belvedere Road, adjacent to the cricket club.  \n\nThis will be indicated on your ticket and will be determined by which stand you are seated in.\n\n**How will I know where I can and cannot go on a matchday?**\n\nMatchday staff will be on hand to help direct you in all areas of the stadium - you will see we will have a one way system in most areas.  \n\nOur stewards and staff will direct you, along with extra information announcements, floor stickers and signage to help you find your way.\n\n**Can we collect autographs from players or see the team coaches?**\n\nUnfortunately we cannot allow access to the first team, visiting team or their staff.  \n\nAt the players entrance, you will see that we have an increased media compound and we now need additional space for the visiting team staff and vehicles.  \n\nWe kindly request that supporters adhere to guidance given when passing this compound (near the Cricket Field Stand entrance) and do not reroute to visit this area. \n\n**Are there areas we cannot enter?**\n\nThe stadium will be split into areas and all our staff will wear accreditation passes to indicate which zone they can work in (red \u002F amber \u002F green).  \n\nSupporters cannot enter red and amber zones.  Red zones are often pitchside or for first team and medical staff - these zones cannot be crossed by other staff or members of the public. \n\nAreas of the stadium previously accessible for supporters may no longer be valid.\n\n**Where do I need to wear a face mask?**\n\nAs general guidance, you would be required to wear a face mask in any area you are mixing with other people on the stadium footprint.  This would include when in queues to the stadium, at the entrance turnstiles, whilst being searched or talking to staff, whilst approaching your seating, when using the toilets, when using the stairways and when seated – the exception when you are eating or drinking.  \n\nWe will issue clear guidance on the wearing of masks in our supporter code of conduct. \n\n**I’m exempt from wearing a mask, do I need to tell you before the match?**\n\nAt the moment - no. However, you must be prepared to be asked by stewarding team if you have a mask, as it is part of their responsibilities to check that masks are worn where appropriate. \n\nWe recommend that fans carry an exemption card or badge, but this is not required by law. Government-approved exemption card are available from [Exemption cards and downloads](http:\u002F\u002Fhttps:\u002F\u002Fwww.gov.uk\u002Fgovernment\u002Fpublications\u002Fface-coverings-when-to-wear-one-and-how-to-make-your-own).\n\nPlease do not to challenge any other supporter questioning if they should be wearing a mask. Instead, please speak with a steward to discuss your concerns.\n\n**Are you offering a discrete identifier I can wear so I’m not repeatedly asked about wearing a mask?**\n\nWe are working on providing supporters with a discreet identifier to advise with out asking that they are exempt and we will advertise this service when its launched.  \n\nThis will be available form the club, free of charge. \n\n**Will you check my temperature at the stadium?**\n\nYes - temperature checks will take place upon arrival. \n\nA reading of 37.8 degrees or above may prevent entry - this decision must be respected.\n\n**Can you confirm what ID checks will take place on matchday?**\n\nAs part of our general ticketing terms and conditions, supporters over 16 can be requested to produce photo ID to prove the correct person is using the ticket. \n\nWe would require that supporters do carry some form of photo ID on a matchday.\n\n**What types of photo ID are accepted?**\n\nWork or professional ID, passport, bus pass, drivers licence, blue badge, student ID or national citizens ID cards.  \n\nWe would advise you contact the club before applying for the ballot if you are concerned about this.  \n\nThere are nationally recognised agencies that will issue national ID cards for UK citizens - we would advise those who do not posses any ID to consider this option as soon as practical.  \n\nWe will ask you to confirm you have photo ID when applying for the ballot.   \n\n**Will there be food and drink available in the stadium on a matchday?**\n\nInitially no - we will not be offering food and drink at reduced capacity matches.  \n\nThis will be reviewed as we move into the season and hopefully increase our capacities.\n\n**Can I purchase food outside the stadium?**\n\nWe would look to permit outside catering facilites on Harry Potts Way and if so, this is something we would advise to you in a prematch guide (via email). \n\nThese would not be operated by the club.\n\n**What changes will there be to matchday facilities?**\n\nWe will advise supporters well in advance to any changes we are making to enable you to best plan your matchday. \n\nWe will advise you in a matchday guide as to what you can bring into the stadium, as we recognise that supporters may want to bring some refreshments with them for the match.  \n\n**Will there be changes to toilet facilities and sanitisation at Turf Moor on matchday?**\n\nEntry to toilets will be limited by number to facilitate social distancing, which may result in queues at peak times.  \n\nWe will operate a one way system where possible and we will have extra sanitisation stations on the concourses and in the toilet facilities.  \n\nWe do encourage supporters to bring their own personal sanitisation items for matchday, which we would ask you to place in a small clear bag. \n\n**What can I bring into the stadium?**\n\nWe will issue clear advice on what you can bring into the stadium on matchday.  \n\nThis will be emailed to you in a matchday guide and as per our usual ground regulations. \n\n**Can I bring my own food and drink to Turf Moor?**\n\nYes - but we will issue guidance regarding this.  \n\nAny food and drink items must be carried in a clear plastic bag and we ask you do not share any drinks bottles or food with anyone.  \n\nSome things will not change and we will not allow alcohol, cans, glass bottles or bottles over 500ml . \n\n**Can we bring a drinks to the stadium for my family?**\n\nWe will welcome a 500ml plastic bottle that will fit into a clear bag \u002F pouch, which can be carried in one hand. \n\nWe would ask you restrict your personal items to this where possible.\n\n**What will be open in the stadium?**\n\nIt is anticipated we will not open food, drink or betting concessions inside the stadium. \n\nInitially we recognise that there will be a demand to bring own drinks into the stadium - we will issue guidance on this by email in a matchday guide.  \n\n**Can I still bring a bag and a flask into the stadium on matchday?**\n\nA small, individual flask in a clear bag is acceptable - whereas a food hamper, cool box or picnic bag is not. \n\nWe will ask for bags and personal items to be minimal on a matchday and be clear  of handbag size to allow a visual search of the items you have.  \n\nWe will remind you of this in the supporter code of conduct that we ask you to agree to.\n\n**Why are you restricting the type of bag I can bring?**\n\nNormal stop and search will be in operation. All searches will need will need to be done in adherence to COVID-19 regulations and may take longer than a ‘normal’ search and this will involve some contact with your belongings.  \n\nThis is why we advise where possible not to bring unnecessary items to the stadium, as it will delay entry into the stadium and increase your contact points with staff.  \n\n**Will you still be operating security searches on a matchday?**\n\nYes we will - your security and the security of the stadium will not be compromised on a matchday.  \n\nBody searches will be performed in accordance with COVID-19 guidance and will not be face to face.  We will have both male and female security and stewards available on a matchday.\n\n**What checks are required of your matchday staff before attending the stadium?**\n\nAll staff that have contact with supporters have exactly the same requirements that are requested of every supporter. \n\nIt is mandatory to complete a prematch health, symptom and travel questionnaire on matchday and have their temperatures taken prior to starting their shift.  \n\nYour health and safety are a priority to us, so we ask our staff to adhere to strict screening protocols too.

Children can easily get lost and within the ground everything looks the same.\n\nYou should always:\u003Cbr\u002F\u003E\n•\tkeep children with you and fully supervise them especially when visiting toilets, be prepared to miss some of the football game to ensure you do this;\u003Cbr\u002F\u003E\n•\thave a pre-agreed meeting point organised and on arrival discuss this with the child in case you get separated.\u003Cbr\u002F\u003E\n•\tshow them who the Stewards are and ensure that they know that they should go to a member of staff if they are lost, scared, or worried.\u003Cbr\u002F\u003E\n\n**Emergencies**\u003Cbr\u002F\u003E\nCould you and your child cope in one?\u003Cbr\u002F\u003E \nWould they be safe in the crowd trying to get quickly out of the stadium all at once? \u003Cbr\u002F\u003E\nIf you had to get out quickly how would you do that safely and together?\u003Cbr\u002F\u003E\nWhere is your nearest emergency escape?\u003Cbr\u002F\u003E \nWhere is your alternative escape route?\u003Cbr\u002F\u003E \nWhere would you meet up outside the ground?\u003Cbr\u002F\u003E \n\nThis should all be considered prior to the game starting, look around you for emergency exits and meeting points and ensure you have a plan just in case.\u003Cbr\u002F\u003E\n\n**Risk from Footballs**\u003Cbr\u002F\u003E\nDuring the warm up and during the game in all areas of the spectator seating there is a risk of being hit by a ball, there are multiple balls, and these could come from any direction on the pitch and when you least expect it and you are perhaps not focused on the pitch. Footballs are hard and can be hit at force and could cause significant injury.  \n\nThere is considered more risk behind the goals or near the corner-flags.\n\n**STAY ALERT AT ALL TIMES**\n\n**Goals**\u003Cbr\u002F\u003E\nWhen a goal is scored the crowd will become very noisy, there will be jumping and some possible surging, how will you ensure that your child feels safe and is not harmed?  Try to watch some videos of crowds celebrating goals prior to arriving to help your child understand what happens which may prepare them a little better.\n\n**The East Lancashire weather**\u003Cbr\u002F\u003E\nThe English Weather is completely unpredictable, and you should be considering what your child may need throughout their visit:\u003Cbr\u002F\u003E\n•\tHigh temperatures and strong sunshine are possible, and this could mean you may be stood in full sun for long periods of time.\u003Cbr\u002F\u003E \n•\tWinter games especially at night, may mean sub-zero temperatures, rain, wind, and snow.  This may also cause tricky conditions under foot when walking to and from the game.\u003Cbr\u002F\u003E\n\nIn extreme weather conditions babies and children respond differently to adults, they can become cold very quickly or dehydrate very quickly depending on the conditions, make sure you make adequate provision.\nIn warmer weather dress appropriately but layer clothing in case it gets colder later, provide lots of drinks and ensure they have a hat and sun cream on and that you bring extra to top up if required. \nIn colder weather or at night, clothe them with layers they can take one off if it’s too much, use at least one more than you are likely to be wearing and they should really have a coat, hat and gloves. Check the weather forecast before you leave and be prepared for it to change and be colder, hotter, or wetter than predicted.\n\n**Noise and Language**\u003Cbr\u002F\u003E\nFootball matches are very noisy events, babies and young children’s hearing is more sensitive than adults and consideration should be given to the impact the loud noise may have on your child, maybe you could consider ear defenders, plugs or muffs.\u003Cbr\u002F\u003E\n\n‘*After age-related hearing loss, research shows that exposure to loud noise is the second most common cause of permanent hearing loss in the world’*.\n\nYoung children may also find the cheering, singing and chanting in some parts of the stadium a little frightening consider the parts of the stand you buy tickets in, take advice from the ticket office on the more appropriate areas.\n\nYou may also find some spectators occasionally using language that is inappropriate for young people to hear, whilst Burnley FC are committed to tackling this, we cannot guarantee that your child will not hear this. However, The Club has a Family Stand for families where such concerns are lessened.\n\n**Final thoughts**\u003Cbr\u002F\u003E\nWe want you and your child to enjoy your visit. \n\nIf you are bringing a child to the stadium think about their needs first. If you cannot guarantee their comfort or safety, then please think about getting a babysitter so you can relax and enjoy the game! \n\nWhere the Club officials are concerned that a child may be suffering harm we may decide that we have to refer our concerns to the Head of Safeguarding, Local Authorities Safeguarding Team or the Police.\n\nIf you have a concern about a child during a match, contact one of the stewards who will be happy to help or alternatively you can contact:\u003Cbr\u002F\u003E\n\nBurnley FC Head of Safeguarding \u003Cbr\u002F\u003E\nHelen Tanner\u003Cbr\u002F\u003E \nHelen is on call at every home game , either on h.tanner@burnleyfc.com or  07714 792507.\n\nLancashire Local Authority Children’s Social Care Duty Team can also be contacted on 0300 123 6720 or if there is an immediate risk of harm contact the Police on 999.\n\n\n",sponsor:{},isHtml:a}],title:"GUIDANCE FOR ADULTS BRINGING CHILDREN TO MATCHES"},{id:"caf456d0-ae60-49e7-970f-6dbe2cfa9fca",children:[{id:"f88ac0ca-d185-4099-b079-aa26b84a4cd1",contentType:d,content:"Burnley FC have comprehensive policies in place to ensure all staff understand what to do to ensure your safety, we also have a child friendly version to support children and young people to understand how they can keep themselves safe.\n\n[Child friendly Safeguarding Policy](https:\u002F\u002Fmedia-cdn.incrowdsports.com\u002Fd3f4bc7f-998e-4592-a4cd-b7f495e5e22a.pdf)\n\n[Safeguarding Children Policy 2020](https:\u002F\u002Fmedia-cdn.incrowdsports.com\u002F0ea67f62-b7cb-4eaf-bbef-47dcdd867f3c.pdf)\n\n[Safeguarding Adults at Risk Policy 2020](https:\u002F\u002Fmedia-cdn.incrowdsports.com\u002F81435e9f-b657-438d-854a-a8562b801b4f.pdf)",sponsor:{},isHtml:a},{id:"a1fd3e70-0511-424d-933c-1dc36a667c7d",contentType:H,sponsor:{}}],title:"POLICY "},{id:"32133566-40ab-4b64-a09e-b2dadcfc0423",children:[{id:"2ad4681f-adce-4606-9cee-db630de40274",contentType:d,content:"**Other useful contacts**\n\nPremier League –  safeguarding@premierleague.com\u003Cbr\u002F\u003E\nFootball Authority (FA) – safeguarding@TheFA.com\u003Cbr\u002F\u003E\n\nLancashire County Council Social Services\u003Cbr\u002F\u003E\n0300 123 6720 – 24 hour helpline\u003Cbr\u002F\u003E\n\nLocal Area Designated Officer -  01772 536694\u003Cbr\u002F\u003E\n\nChild line – 0800 1111\u003Cbr\u002F\u003E\n\nNational Domestic Abuse Helpline – 0808 2000 247\u003Cbr\u002F\u003E\n\nMind – 0300 123 3393\u003Cbr\u002F\u003E\n\nConfidential anti-terrorist helpline – 0800 789 321\u003Cbr\u002F\u003E\n\n\n\n**There are also useful resources on a number of subjects here:**\n\nNSPCC Child Protection in Sport Unit - https:\u002F\u002Fthecpsu.org.uk\u002F\u003Cbr\u002F\u003E\n\nThink you know – advice and guidance to safeguard children on and off line - https:\u002F\u002Fwww.thinkuknow.co.uk\u002F\u003Cbr\u002F\u003E\n\nAnn Craft Trust – A leading UK authority on safeguarding adults and young people at risk - https:\u002F\u002Fwww.anncrafttrust.org\u002F\u003Cbr\u002F\u003E\n\nCEOP – Child Exploitation and Online Protection - https:\u002F\u002Fwww.ceop.police.uk\u002Fsafety-centre\u002F\u003Cbr\u002F\u003E\n\nDomestic Violence UK - https:\u002F\u002Fdomesticviolenceuk.org\u002F\u003Cbr\u002F\u003E\n\nMind – Mental Health Charity - https:\u002F\u002Fwww.mind.org.uk\u002F\u003Cbr\u002F\u003E\n\nHeads Together – offer a wide range of signposting to mental health support for all - https:\u002F\u002Fwww.headstogether.org.uk\u002Fget-support\u002F\u003Cbr\u002F\u003E\n\n",sponsor:{},isHtml:a}],title:"OTHER CONTACTS AND RESOURCES "},{id:"582c60bc-c537-4106-877b-a56976a8ae87",children:[{id:"48635223-c005-45b3-8cbc-44623d8e0768",contentType:d,content:"Every Club has a Dedicated Football Officer (DFO) here at Burnley FC we have Ross Bosdorff, who has been a Police Officer for almost 20 years.\n\nIn 2018 Ross became the DFO for Burnley FC.\n\nHis role isnt just arresting and banning supporters although you will be aware that this does play a part from time to time.

You all help to make a difference.\n\n“The future is extremely bright for all of us, although in the short term we know we all face unique challenges brought about by the coronavirus pandemic.\n\n“Issuing the club accounts is a legal requirement but our immediate thoughts are with those dealing with the effects of the current on-going situation.\n\n“We are working closely with the Premier League and the relevant authorities regarding footballing matters, while off the field making sure the club continues to operate effectively and all staff, family and fans stay as safe and healthy and well supported as possible.\n\n“We also urge you to follow all Government guidelines in trying to restrict the spread of the virus and by doing so look forward to the day when we can all meet again at Turf Moor and celebrate playing football in a safe environment.”\n\nElsewhere in the annual accounts, match income was shown to have risen from £5.6m to £6.3m in the 12 months up to last June.\n\nCatering and retail sales stayed almost static at around £2.6m and £1.8m respectively, while income from other commercial activity rose from £7.3m to £12m.\n\n**[Financial Report for year ending June, 2019](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.burnleyfootballclub.com\u002Fsiteassets\u002Fdocuments\u002Faccounts\u002Faccounts-and-chairmans-report-2019.pdf)**\n\n**[Chairman's statement for year ending June, 2019](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.burnleyfootballclub.com\u002Fsiteassets\u002Fdocuments\u002Faccounts\u002Fchairmans-report-2019.pdf)**",sponsor:{},isHtml:a}],language:i,version:o,source:{sourceSystem:j,overwriteEnabled:a},articleMetadata:{},categories:[{id:aO,text:aG},{id:C,text:G}],displayCategory:{id:aO,text:aG},slug:"club-accounts",clientId:f,singlePage:h,linkedIds:[{text:qC,sourceSystem:c,sourceSystemId:"aa225cff-e90d-4f38-8f21-e9ddb186fc27"}],heroMedia:{content:{id:"78517818-5694-4ad4-9771-31d35d8e36de",contentType:e,title:qC,image:"https:\u002F\u002Fmedia-cdn.incrowdsports.com\u002Faa225cff-e90d-4f38-8f21-e9ddb186fc27.jpg",sponsor:{}},title:"Club Accounts"},readTimeMinutes:w,author:{name:b,title:b,imageUrl:b,socialHandles:[]},publishDate:"2020-09-04T14:28:57.870Z",auth:{loginRequired:a,roles:[]},pinned:a,blocked:a},{id:"20b545e6-12a3-4c4c-a620-777b28afda0c",content:[{id:"a9358061-53ec-4d6b-8adc-50f68ba9982a",contentType:d,content:"Only official Football League licenced organisations are able to be accredited at Turf Moor.\n\nThis can be done online at DataCo, or by email: accreditation@burnleyfc.com\n \nCar parking is limited and at the discretion of the club.\n \nThe press room at Turf Moor is accessed via the main car park on Harry Potts Way and is situated in the corner of the stadium between the James Hargreaves and David Fishwick Stands.\n \nThere is complimentary wifi for all media and ISDN lines are available for visiting clubs on a reciprocal basis.\n \nThe media department can be contacted on 01282 704701.\n \nLocal Newspapers: The Burnley Express, The Lancashire Telegraph.\nLocal Radio: BBC Radio Lancashire (95.5 FM)",sponsor:{},isHtml:a}],language:i,version:o,source:{sourceSystem:j,overwriteEnabled:a},articleMetadata:{},categories:[{id:aO,text:aG},{id:C,text:G}],displayCategory:{id:aO,text:aG},slug:"media-accreditation2",clientId:f,singlePage:h,linkedIds:[{text:el,sourceSystem:c,sourceSystemId:jb}],heroMedia:{content:{id:"3ed9c8eb-4576-4c66-a9fa-67195015e274",contentType:e,title:el,image:"https:\u002F\u002Fmedia-cdn.incrowdsports.com\u002Ff8e0d98e-6e9e-4bd8-bbed-b0c246a783f0.jpg",sponsor:{}},title:"Media Accreditation"},readTimeMinutes:g,author:{name:b,title:b,imageUrl:b,socialHandles:[]},publishDate:"2020-09-04T14:08:05.155Z",auth:{loginRequired:a,roles:[]},pinned:a,blocked:a},{id:"f62055e1-e537-4159-a5c0-adf553ea7937",content:[{id:"eb440805-3179-417e-9d63-40a8400f6dfb",contentType:aZ,children:[{id:"50a87022-d276-43f2-8e5c-6b6e8b045348",children:[{id:"ee957381-1eaa-4321-97d9-a4d9e5e3c197",contentType:d,content:"Turf Moor capacity: 21,944\n\nBuilt: 1883\n\nPitch size: 105m x 68m\n\nStadium address: \nTurf Moor\nHarry Potts Way\nBurnley\nLancashire\nBB10 4BX\n\nPhone: +44 (0) 1282 446800",sponsor:{},isHtml:a}],title:"Stadium Details"},{id:"170eaaa3-dca5-45f0-b6b8-d7c05623e801",children:[{id:"2cd67f27-abb2-400d-bdec-15ef5f5aab32",contentType:d,content:"Burnley Football Club\nTurf Moor \nHarry Potts Way \nBurnley \nLancashire \nBB10 4BX\n\nTelephone Numbers\n\nGeneral Enquiries: **01282 446 800**\n\n**Downloadable Guides**\nWhether you are a home supporter or a visiting fan we have information regarding match days at Turf Moor including services we offer, travel \ninformation and directions.\n\nWe are currently working on updating our downloadable matchday guides, in the meantime please email info@burnleyfc.com if you have any specific questions.\n\n**Directions by Road**\n\nFrom the East:\nExit M65 at junction 12 and follow signs to 'Burnley North A682,' over two roundabouts and into Colne Road.

Introduction\n\nThis Policy sets out the obligations of Burnley Football Club (“the Company”) regarding data protection and the rights of customers, business contacts and employees (“data subjects”) in respect of their personal data under the General Data Protection Regulation (“the Regulation”).\n\nThe Regulation defines “personal data” as any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (a data subject); an identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier, or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural, or social identity of that natural person.\n\nThis Policy sets out the procedures that are to be followed when dealing with personal data.  The procedures and principles set out herein must be followed at all times by the Company, its employees, agents, contractors, or other parties working on behalf of the Company.\n\nThe Company is committed not only to the letter of the law, but also to the spirit of the law and places high importance on the correct, lawful, and fair handling of all personal data, respecting the legal rights, privacy, and trust of all individuals with whom it deals.\n \n\n2.            The Data Protection Principles\n\nThis Policy aims to ensure compliance with the Regulation.  The Regulation sets out the following principles with which any party handling personal data must comply.  All personal data must be:\n\na)            processed lawfully, fairly, and in a transparent manner in relation to the data subject;\n\nb)            collected for specified, explicit, and legitimate purposes and not further processed in a manner that is incompatible with those purposes; further processing for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes shall not be considered to be incompatible with the initial purposes;\n\nc)            adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which it is processed;\n\nd)            accurate and, where necessary, kept up to date; every reasonable step must be taken to ensure that personal data that is inaccurate, having regard to the purposes for which they are processed, is erased or rectified without delay;\n\ne)            kept in a form which permits identification of data subjects for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which the personal data is processed; personal data may be stored for longer periods insofar as the personal data will be processed solely for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes subject to implementation of the appropriate technical and organisational measures required by the Regulation in order to safeguard the rights and freedoms of the data subject;\n\nf)             processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security of the personal data, including protection against unauthorised or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction or damage, using appropriate technical or organisational measures.\n \n\n3.            Lawful, Fair, and Transparent Data Processing\n\nThe Regulation seeks to ensure that personal data is processed lawfully, fairly, and transparently, without adversely affecting the rights of the data subject.  The Regulation states that processing of personal data shall be lawful if at least one of the following applies:\n\na)            the data subject has given consent to the processing of his or her personal data for one or more specific purposes;\n\nb)            processing is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is a party or in order to take steps at the request of the data subject prior to entering into a contract;\n\nc)            processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the controller is subject;\n\nd)            processing is necessary to protect the vital interests of the data subject or of another natural person;\n\ne)            processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller;\n\nf)             processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the controller or by a third party, except where such interests are overridden by the fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject which require protection of personal data, in particular where the data subject is a child.\n \n\n4.            Processed for Specified, Explicit and Legitimate Purposes\n\n4.1          The Company collects and processes the personal data set out in Part 21 of this Policy.  This may include personal data received directly from data subjects (for example, contact details used when a data subject communicates with us) and data received from third parties (for example, club sponsors, partners, community, lottery, ticketing and retail solutions software, competitions, EFL, Premier League, FIFA, UEFA, The FA and its subsidiaries and partners).\n\n4.2          The Company only processes personal data for the specific purposes set out in Part 21 of this Policy (or for other purposes expressly permitted by the Regulation).  The purposes for which we process personal data will be informed to data subjects at the time that their personal data is collected, where it is collected directly from them, or as soon as possible (not more than one calendar month) after collection where it is obtained from a third party.\n \n\n5.            Adequate, Relevant and Limited Data Processing\n\nThe Company will only collect and process personal data for and to the extent necessary for the specific purpose(s) informed to data subjects as under Part 4, above.\n \n\n6.            Accuracy of Data and Keeping Data Up To Date\n\nThe Company shall ensure that all personal data collected and processed is kept accurate and up-to-date.  The accuracy of data shall be checked when it is collected and at intervals thereafter. Where any inaccurate or out-of-date data is found, all reasonable steps will be taken without delay to amend or erase that data, as appropriate.\n \n\n7.            Timely Processing\n\nThe Company shall not keep personal data for any longer than is necessary in light of the purposes for which that data was originally collected and processed.  When the data is no longer required, all reasonable steps will be taken to erase it without delay.\n\n\n8.            Secure Processing\n\nThe Company shall ensure that all personal data collected and processed is kept secure and protected against unauthorised or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction or damage.  Further details of the data protection and organisational measures which shall be taken are provided in Parts 22 and 23 of this Policy.\n\n\n9.

The procedures and principles set out herein must be followed at all times by the Company, its employees, agents, contractors, or other parties working on behalf of the Company.\n\nThe Company is committed not only to the letter of the law, but also to the spirit of the law and places high importance on the correct, lawful, and fair handling of all personal data, respecting the legal rights, privacy, and trust of all individuals with whom it deals.\n\n \n\nThe Data Protection Principles\nThis Policy aims to ensure compliance with the Regulation.  The Regulation sets out the following principles with which any party handling personal data must comply.  All personal data must be:\n\na)            processed lawfully, fairly, and in a transparent manner in relation to the data subject;\n\nb)            collected for specified, explicit, and legitimate purposes and not further processed in a manner that is incompatible with those purposes; further processing for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes shall not be considered to be incompatible with the initial purposes;\n\nc)            adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which it is processed;\n\nd)            accurate and, where necessary, kept up to date; every reasonable step must be taken to ensure that personal data that is inaccurate, having regard to the purposes for which they are processed, is erased or rectified without delay;\n\ne)            kept in a form which permits identification of data subjects for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which the personal data is processed; personal data may be stored for longer periods insofar as the personal data will be processed solely for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes subject to implementation of the appropriate technical and organisational measures required by the Regulation in order to safeguard the rights and freedoms of the data subject;\n\nf)             processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security of the personal data, including protection against unauthorised or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction or damage, using appropriate technical or organisational measures.\n\n \n\nLawful, Fair, and Transparent Data Processing\nThe Regulation seeks to ensure that personal data is processed lawfully, fairly, and transparently, without adversely affecting the rights of the data subject.  The Regulation states that processing of personal data shall be lawful if at least one of the following applies:\n\na)            the data subject has given consent to the processing of his or her personal data for one or more specific purposes;\n\nb)            processing is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is a party or in order to take steps at the request of the data subject prior to entering into a contract;\n\nc)            processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the controller is subject;\n\nd)            processing is necessary to protect the vital interests of the data subject or of another natural person;\n\ne)            processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller;\n\nf)             processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the controller or by a third party, except where such interests are overridden by the fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject which require protection of personal data, in particular where the data subject is a child.\n\n \n\nProcessed for Specified, Explicit and Legitimate Purposes\n4.1          The Company collects and processes the personal data set out in Part 21 of this Policy.

Football Pools is back and the club’s official charity, Burnley FC in the Community is set to benefit.**\n\nBurnley FC, The Football Pools and Burnley FC in the Community have formed a new partnership which will see the well-loved game relaunched to Clarets fans, with funds generated from game-playing donated back to the club’s award-winning charitable arm.\n\nThe Football Pools, which asks players to attempt to correctly predict eight score draws from the 49 fixtures, has been a firm favourite for football-lovers since 1923.\n\nNow relaunched online for the digital era, players can easily place their bets and pay online at the long-standing price of just £1 per game.\n\nWith huge cash prizes, including a £3M Jackpot on offer for those who earn 24 points (eight correct score draws), as well as numerous other cash prizes up for grabs, Burnley fans can land themselves a sizeable win whilst also generating key revenue for projects such as the Danny Ings Disability Sports Project, Burnley Community Kitchen and the 50+ other community programmes currently supporting over 27,000 local people. \n\nNeil Hart, then Chief Executive Officer, Burnley FC in the Community said: “The Football Pools is a well-known, traditional game that many of us are familiar with and they have a long history of giving back to football clubs via their community trusts.”\n\n“The relaunch of the Pools online opens up the game to a new audience and allows fans to enjoy this classic way of betting in a whole new way.\n\n“The donations generated from fans playing this game will support us significantly as we continue to expand our reach across East Lancashire.\n\n“We will reinvest the funds generated back into the community via our myriad of community projects that are supporting some of the most vulnerable people living in our local area.”\n\nFootball Pools Chief Executive Office Derek Lloyd added: “We are delighted to announce our new partnership with Burnley FC and Burnley FC in the Community.\n\nWe are sure the club's magnificent fan base will enjoy playing the Football Pools for a chance to win big prizes, including a £3m jackpot plus exclusive Burnley FC related prizes.\n\nWe are especially excited that every customer who signed up will be able to support the great work being done by Burnley FC in the Community.”\n\nThe partnership will be launched on the 1st March, ahead of the Burnley FC vs Crystal Palace Premier League fixture at Turf Moor.\n\nYou can sign up to play The Football Pools [**HERE**](https:\u002F\u002Fburnley.footballpools.com\u002F) and,

be back and Matej Vydra could also return to face one of his former loan clubs on Saturday.\n\nBut the Clarets will be missing widemen Johann Berg Gudmundsson and Robbie Brady for the visit of West Bromwich Albion after the duo both picked up injuries as Burnley kept another bottom-three side at arm’s length.\n\nGudmundsson – who had scored in his previous two games after seemingly getting back to full fitness – went off in the first half of Wednesday night’s 1-1 draw with Fulham with a hamstring problem.\n\n","874d0bf8-e54a-45cf-adc9-62e18ec045a0","https:\u002F\u002Fmedia-cdn.incrowdsports.com\u002Ff6690041-e62e-433b-82d3-68988b529c57.jpg","c1de48c9-96db-4470-a042-05452ce42134","And Brady didn’t last long as his replacement, with an ankle issue forcing his early withdrawal 20 minutes after the break.\n\n“It doesn’t look great with Johann and Robbie going off,” said manager Sean Dyche.\n\n“Johann has looked free-flowing so that one’s a bit of a disappointment to us.\n\n“We’ll find out more in the next 24 hours and probably get them scanned just as a precaution.\n\n“We don’t think either is drastic but we keep getting these knocks in this heavy game schedule and it is affecting us.”\n\nCentre-back Mee will return after completing a six-day absence under the rules for a concussion injury, while Vydra is in contention for a place in the squad against the Baggies, where the striker had his first taste of the Premier League in the 2013\u002F14 season.\n","c8f17ec4-cd0d-4a3e-b05f-03f76739694c","https:\u002F\u002Fmedia-cdn.incrowdsports.com\u002Fd80b5fef-b43c-4b37-9d30-daf2df015fc2.jpg","3f7002a8-0b20-41e3-a807-b306c8ebc364","“Ben Mee comes back and Matej Vydra, as long as he comes through training today, should be back in and around it,” added Dyche, whose side is 14 points better off than 19th-placed West Brom going into Saturday’s meeting at Turf Moor.\n\n“Kevin Long did very well last night so it’s good to see him step in again and deliver a performance.\n\n“But Ben, over time, has proved his worth both as a captain and a player alike. It’s good to have anyone back!\n\n“It’s a couple back, a couple out – it’s trying to juggle the pack.\n\n“It’s not the perfect scenario but a scenario we’ve had for a while now, so we’re kind of adapting to it.”\n\nChris Wood, who also started his top-flight career with Albion, is closing in on a return but may not be ready to face his former club as the Clarets seek the win that could lift them as high as 13th place in the table. \n\nMidfielder Dale Stephens remains sidelined and Erik Pieters is also a doubt after a groin injury forced him to miss the draw with Fulham as Burnley extended their unbeaten league run to three games.\n","Mee tunnel.jpg","03031c93-a58b-4d43-a6d2-f9780b5566bf","Brady Fulham.jpg","f6690041-e62e-433b-82d3-68988b529c57","Vydra shot saved.jpg","d80b5fef-b43c-4b37-9d30-daf2df015fc2","c6868576-d74b-4add-83f4-17b7f9e7893c","https:\u002F\u002Fmedia-cdn.incrowdsports.com\u002F03031c93-a58b-4d43-a6d2-f9780b5566bf.jpg?crop=1184:444:nowe:165:66","https:\u002F\u002Fmedia-cdn.incrowdsports.com\u002F03031c93-a58b-4d43-a6d2-f9780b5566bf.jpg","Two In, Two Out As Dyche Does The Injuries Shuffle","Ben Mee and Matej Vydra set to return as the Clarets aim to extend unbeaten run against the Baggies","2021-02-18T15:00:00.000Z","two-in-two-out-as-dyche-does-the-injuries-shuffle","7f5b7c8e-b66f-42fc-9b1f-d369dcc1496b","1ef02800-ba1b-4b09-b4e1-273eeab6d350","Lewis Richardson and Max Thompson were both on target twice as the Under-23s enjoyed a superb win at Manchester United.\n\nThe Clarets followed up their recent visit to Liverpool with another friendly against top-flight opposition in Premier League 2.\n\nAnd Steve Stone’s side made the most of the trip to Carrington with an excellent performance capped by doubles from Richardson and Thompson and a fifth goal from Under-18s striker Sam Unwin against his former club.\n\nU23s boss Stone has been eager to test his players against a range of opposition across a busier fixture schedule.\n\nAnd following a 1-0 league defeat at Crystal Palace on Monday, the Clarets return to Premier League 2 Second Division action next Monday when they entertain Middlesbrough at Curzon Ashton.\n","Thompson team cele.jpg","07262d44-49b9-4d87-93af-5fe8ac3730a6","4b99c61e-cb5c-4d74-984c-b2ca4655195d","https:\u002F\u002Fmedia-cdn.incrowdsports.com\u002F07262d44-49b9-4d87-93af-5fe8ac3730a6.jpg?crop=819:307:nowe:196:134","https:\u002F\u002Fmedia-cdn.incrowdsports.com\u002F07262d44-49b9-4d87-93af-5fe8ac3730a6.jpg","U23s Friendly: Manchester United 1 Burnley 5","Forwards at the double as young Clarets secure training-ground win","2021-02-18T14:00:00.000Z","u23s-friendly-manchester-united-1-burnley-5","8aa39792-cc10-4b89-a820-7175722a682e","523b1c02-02f5-41cf-a8fa-9b3c47c8b946","Strike partners Ashley Barnes and Jay Rodriguez were happy with their night’s work after combining to produce a priceless point.\n\nRodriguez superbly teed up Barnes for the equaliser which secured a 1-1 draw against Fulham.\n\nAnd with Barnes claiming his third in nine league games to swiftly cancel out the Cottagers’ scrambled opener, the Clarets moved up to 15th place in the table and remained eight points clear of Fulham and the Premier League’s bottom three.\n\n“We had to react quickly,” said Barnes, who struck three minutes after Ola Aina had turned in a Fulham corner early in the second half.\n\n","a11b5d5c-a5d6-4f9a-adc6-9925622df56b","98aa742b-1e2d-42da-b5b5-ff20499cf78a","“The credit goes to Jay.

League’s bottom three as they again came from behind to earn a precious reward.\n\nFor the third time in four top-flight games at Turf Moor, Burnley wiped out a deficit as they extended their unbeaten league run to three matches.\n\nAshley Barnes’ swift response to the visitors’ opening goal four minutes into the second half was enough to deny draw specialists Fulham a fourth win of the season as they remain adrift in the relegation places.\n\nAnd the striker's third goal of the season also allowed Sean Dyche’s injury-hit men to move back up a place to 15th in the table as they continue to close in on safety.\n\nAs well as the absence of Ben Mee as a result of the concussion he sustained in Saturday’s win at Crystal Palace, the Clarets’ back four was also missing the injured Erik

debut goals he scored in securing Fulham’s first win since the end of November at Everton last weekend.\n\nBut that apart Burnley’s back four was barely stretched in a first half in which goalkeeper Nick Pope didn’t have a save to make.\n\nFulham keeper Alphonse Areola wasn’t over-employed either, but the Clarets still looked the likelier scorers before the break.\n\nLong had a chance to make an

Rodriguez were only inches away from steering into the net.\n\nFulham had been unbeaten in their previous five away games and were looking to equal a top-flight record of six in a row undefeated on the road.\n\nAnd their cause was helped five minutes into the second half when they took the lead.\n\nThe Londoners had looked all night to strike on the break and when they counter-attacked to force a corner, Joachim Andersen’s flick bounced in off the chest of Ola Aina with substitute Robbie Brady – who had replaced the injured Johann Berg Gudmundsson before going off himself with a knock – unable to clear off the line.\n\nThat goal stung the Clarets but crucially they were behind for just three

second attempt and then keep his composure to calmly stroke home his third goal in nine league games.\n\nImmediately the Clarets went for the kill with Areola saving from a rejuvenated Rodriguez as the striker searched for the 100th league goal of his career.\n\nAnd Brady then headed an excellent cross from Taylor wide shortly before making way for Brownhill.\n\nBut having weathered that spell of pressure, Fulham sensed there might be a winner for them and Pope was called into action for the first time as he saved Maja’s skidding

our 2020\u002F2021 home kit.\n\nThe design takes inspiration from the kit worn by one of the greatest squad of players in the club’s history; commemorating the 1920\u002F1921 League Championship winning heroes of 100 years ago.\n\nWith a First Division title, as well as achieving an unbeaten Football League record of 30 games that would last for 80 years, the likes of manager John Haworth, the famed halfback line of George Halley, captain Tommy Boyle and Billy Watson, and top goalscorer Joe Anderson, among others listed below, became household names in their unrelenting charge towards the first of the two English championship trophies won by the club in its long and proud history as one of football’s founder members.\n\nA century on from this historic milestone, we couldn’t be more proud to commemorate these 100 year heroes.\n\nDeveloped by Umbro, the new home kit uses the classic design from 100 years ago as its influence, with the blue collar prominent in a stylised ‘cut’ neckline that adds a modern twist.\n\nThe traditional blue sleeves are also a distinguished feature, as they sit lower on the arm.\n\nThe ‘Legs, Hearts, Minds’ tri-colour stripe, which  has been adopted as a mantra in the Sean Dyche era, adds another modern touch to the back neckline, along with the official licensed label to the side seam.\n\nThe shirt is complemented by white shorts with claret contrast side tipping, and claret socks with blue contrast cuff and BFC wording.\n\nThe 2020\u002F2021 ‘100 year heroes’ kit is on sale now [online](https:\u002F\u002Fshop.burnleyfc.com\u002F) and in store.\n\n\n**The 100 Year heroes.**\n\nManager: John Haworth\n\nSquad: Tommy Boyle (Captain), Joe Anderson, Alf Basnett, Frank Birchenough, Tom Brophy, Benny Cross, Jerry Dawson, George
